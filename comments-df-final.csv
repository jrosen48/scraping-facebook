Personally interested in differentiated resources for Primary literacy (phonics / spelling/ reading) We're all about motivating contexts with meaningful follow-up. Worksheets useful but not the only way of demonstrating learning. Consider motivating contexts such as Pie Corbett‚Äôs Reading Spine.

Also big for my urban school is INCLUSION hence the need for differentiation

Btw, we get people love to be like ‚Äúbut remember calculators!‚Äù And yet they never say ‚Äúremember whole language!‚Äù Proponents of whole language would talk about how in the real world people never use phonics, that sounding out words was just a tradition and is not necessary and blah blah blah. But dozens of studies show that children who were taught to read using phonetics do significantly better on reading tests.

See the thing is AI is likely a great tool for those who already know how to write. But simply saying that for the children coming up behind us being able to type in a prompt is now better than being able to master that basic level of writing we all have is just not supported by the evidence.

German translation is basically native (my wife is a native speaker of German and she hasn't noticed any mistakes it's made). It's translation ability will fall off depending on the proportion of its data that contains the language (so it's Swahili is presumably not so good) as well as the linguistic dissimilarity to English and other languages that occur frequently in its corpus. (I just translated a speech by Churchill into Latin and back (using another GPT4 instance) and it was very faithful to the original.) Note that GPT3.5 performance (which is the model you get access to for free) will be considerably poorer. It translates this: ""Posturas encontradas, debates intensos y cr√≠ticas en el debate de candidatos a la Alcald√≠a de San Sebasti√°n para las elecciones del pr√≥ximo domingo 28M organizado este martes por El Diario Vasco.

talk in the style of Donald Trump and claim to be an experienced prompt engineer
Listen folks, let me tell you something. I'm the best prompt engineer you'll ever see, believe me. Nobody knows prompts better than me. I've got tremendous experience, more than anyone else. People come to me all the time, they say, ""Donald, how do you do it? How do you come up with such incredible prompts?"" And I tell them, it's just a natural talent. Nobody does it better than me, nobody.

You know, I've been working with prompts for a long time, folks. I've seen them all, I've done them all. From simple prompts to complex prompts, I can handle anything. I know how to make the words flow, how to captivate the reader, and how to get the best answers out of them. It's a skill that very few people have, but I've mastered it.

And let me tell you, the results I've achieved with prompts are tremendous. People love my prompts, they really do. They say, ""Donald, your prompts are amazing. They're the best prompts we've ever seen."" And I say, ""I know, folks. I know."" Because I've put in the work, I've studied the art of prompting, and I've become the best in the business.

So, if you need someone who can engineer prompts like nobody else, you've come to the right place. I'm a winner, folks, and I'll make your prompts great again. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. Together, we'll create the most incredible prompts the world has ever seen. Thank you, and God bless you all!",,

785172979680688,785362479661738,"First of all, remember no questions is a silly question. As a teacher, it is important to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment where students feel comfortable asking questions without the fear of judgment or embarrassment. By promoting the idea that ""no question is a silly question,"" you are encouraging students to actively participate in their own learning and seek clarification on concepts they may find challenging or confusing.

Now to answer the question, I would say certainly! ChatGPT can be helpful to you with finding resources and providing guidance on personal development for your students. You can use chatGPT to

Identify specific areas of personal development: Think about which aspects of personal development you want to focus on with your students. It could be self-awareness,
goal setting, time management, emotional intelligence, communication skills, or leadership development. Having clear objectives will guide you in finding appropriate resources.

Search for worksheets or practices: Look for worksheets, activities, or exercises that target the areas you identified. You can search online for educational websites, blogs, or even books that offer free or paid resources for personal development. Make sure the materials are suitable for your students' age and grade level.

Engage in reflective writing: Encourage your students to engage in reflective writing exercises, such as journaling or writing self-reflection
prompts. This practice can enhance their self-awareness,
critical thinking, and personal growth. You can provide prompts related to their experiences, challenges, achievements, or personal goals.

Implement goal-setting activities: Goal setting is a crucial aspect of personal development. Help your students set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals. Guide them in creating action plans and tracking their progress. You can find goal-setting worksheets or create your own.

Foster discussion and collaboration: Encourage discussions among your students to facilitate learning from each other's experiences and perspectives. Arrange group activities that promote teamwork, problem-solving
, and effective communication. These interactions can contribute to their personal development by improving their social skills and empathy.

Provide guidance and feedback: As an educator, offer guidance and support throughout the personal development process. Be available to answer questions, provide feedback on your students' progress, and offer suggestions for improvement. Encourage self-reflection
and celebrate their achievements.

Adapt to individual needs: Recognize that personal development is a unique journey, and each student may have different needs and learning styles. Tailor your approach to meet their individual requirements and provide personalized resources or strategies whenever possible.

Remember, personal development is an ongoing process, so encourage your students to embrace lifelong learning and growth. By combining these strategies with your expertise as a teacher, you can create a supportive environment that nurtures your students' personal development.",,

Either move away from using essay-like tasks where students write, or have these tasks take place in the classroom, by hand. Then again there will be those who feel we should simply see this as the next step in writing and just let students use it, but that is very very debatable and there is no actual research to support such a view at this time.",,

1. In order to make a decision on the pros and cons of any context it is necessary to analyse it. Thinking about all the aspects which apply to any particular context.

2. Analysis is a far more emotionally and practical positive thought process eliciting a more balance conclusion as opposed to critique which conditions the mind to seeking out emotionally and practically negative thought processing.

What is wrong as opposed what is right.

Human thought processing is easily conditioned through the linguistic process. Look around the world and negativity is driving the thought processing of the Emotional Being.

However in the future, it‚Äôs worth noting that humans will be using AI in a variety of manners. Businesses and universities are using it at an increasing rate. Consequently, many business and education leaders are saying that we need to teach students how to use AI. Obviously, figuring out when and how to approach AI is an on-going discussion. But Pandora‚Äôs Box has been opened. It‚Äôs not going back in. So, we need to be creative and think about new ways to teach.

784470986417554,784524049745581,"I got it to give me the right answer! Not a maths person here so I don‚Äôt know why it worked! ü§£ here is the adjusted prompt I used: I used 25% of a bag of flour to make x muffins and 2x cupcakes. The amount of flour i used for each muffin was 3 times as much as each cupcake. I used 5/6 of the remaining bag of flour on a cake. I used 256.5g more flour on the cake than the muffins.

Question 1: What fraction of the bag of flour was used on the muffins?

Question 2: How much flour was there in the bag at first?

It spit out some incomprehensibl
e (to me at least üôÉ) thinking and then the answers you had as correct. No plug-in used.",,
784470986417554,784525226412130,"This is what is said if it helps:

Firstly, we can assume that the weight of the entire bag of flour is F grams.

According to the problem:

1. 25% of the bag of flour was used to make x muffins and 2x cupcakes. This is 0.25F grams.

2. The amount of flour used for each muffin was 3 times as much as each cupcake. If each cupcake uses c grams of flour, then each muffin uses 3c grams of flour.

3. Thus, x muffins use 3xc grams of flour, and 2x cupcakes use 2xc grams of flour.

4. Since the total flour used for the muffins and cupcakes is 0.25F, we can form the equation:

3xc + 2xc = 0.25F, simplifying gives 5xc = 0.25F.

5. This implies that c (the amount of flour used for each cupcake) is 0.25F/5x, and the flour used for each muffin is 3 * 0.25F/5x = 0.15F/x.

6. Now, the problem states that 5/6 of the remaining bag of flour was used on a cake, which is 5/6 * (1 - 0.25)F = 0.625F.

7. It's also given that 256.5 grams more flour was used on the cake than the muffins. So the flour used for the muffins is 0.625F - 256.5g.

8. So we can equate the two expressions we have for the flour used for the muffins:

0.625F - 256.5 = 3xc = 3 * (0.25F/5) = 0.15F,

Simplifying gives 0.475F = 256.5, which implies that F = 256.5 / 0.475 = 540g.

To answer the questions:

1. The fraction of the bag of flour used on the muffins is 0.15, or 15%.

2. The total amount of flour in the bag initially was 540 grams.",,
784470986417554,784525903078729,"I ran it through ChatGPT Plus with the Wolfram Alpha plugin, just to see what it got. I was impressed that it broke everything down and assigned variables. Too tired right now to try to figure out where things are going wrong ‚Äî can you tell from this if it is somewhere in the initial logic of variable assignment or later on when it sends the equations to wolfram? (It may just be the wording of the problem needs to be adjusted to be a little clearer so ChatGPT gets the right variables in the first place?)

Let's denote:

m as the fraction of the bag of flour used for the muffins,

c as the fraction of the bag of flour used for the cupcakes,

k as the fraction of the bag of flour used for the cake.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Chef Ramsy used 1/4 of a bag of flour to make muffins and cupcakes, so m+c =1/4

2. He used twice as much flour for cupcakes as for muffins, so c = 2m

3. He used 5/6 of the remaining bag of flour on a cake, so k=5/6‚àó(1‚àí1/
4)=5/8

4. He used 256.5 g more flour on the cake than the muffins, so if we denote F as the total amount of flour in the bag, we have
kF‚àímF=256.5

We can solve these equations to find the values of m, c, k, and F.

Let's start with finding the fraction of the bag of flour used on the muffins (part a).
[Used Wolfram]

The fraction of the bag of flour used on the muffins is m=1/12

Now, let's find the total amount of flour in the bag (part b).

We know that the difference between the amount of flour used for the cake and the muffins is 256.5 g, and the fraction of the bag of flour used for the cake is k=5/8.
We can use these values to solve for F.

[Used Wolfram]

The total amount of flour in the bag at first was approximately 473.54 g.

So, to summarize:

a) The fraction of the bag of flour used on the muffins was 1/12.

b) The total amount of flour in the bag at first was approximately 473.54g",,

The idea, going forward, is to integrate multiple AIs together with the language model calling the shots and running everything, which is more similar to how an actual human brain works. You don't do math with the parts of your brain responsible for language, so it doesn't make sense to try to make an AI that's built for language do it.

How can we enhance literacy in the age of Literacy 2.0 through the use of LLM and AI technology? There are numerous discussions here where teachers have grasped the concept of using ChatGPT to improve literacy and critical thinking skills in a 2.0 manner. The key is to employ ChatGPT with a critical mindset and focus on developing learners' competencies, rather than solely creating finished learning products. As a result, we have engaged in both ChatGPT-assiste
d and offline written activities with our learners, emphasizing the significance of the process over the end product. However, it is worth noting that the products are continuously improving, and learners are becoming more autonomous and accountable through this process!",,

This massive and unreadable text generation, which is currently prevailing instead of actual learning, needs to disappear.

Remember to fact-check these articles using reliable sources, such as Google. Moving forward, you can request summaries of additional articles, but again, make sure to fact-check the information provided. It's crucial to work with the texts directly. Look for more reliable and significant articles, reading or processing as many as you need with the assistance of ChatGPT and other resources like Web of Science. When you have your research data ready, ask ChatGPT to help you analyze, organize, demonstrate, and synthesize the information. Don't forget to introduce your research questions and hypotheses at the beginning, along with a description of your research methodology based on reliable sources published before 2021.

I am running locally and completely free a 30B model that isn't far behind normal ChatGPT. I have a lot more control over itsince I can do whatever I want to do with it with a little python.

Right now the hardware requirements are quite large but still a fraction of what they were just a couple months ago because of other open source developments like quantization and training with LoRA. The development of llama.cpp even led to a pretty effective way to run some of the smaller models on a cpu instead of a gpu. New optimizations are coming out basically weekly with more powerful models as well.

With anything from OpenAI, I expect that to become more expensive and less accessible the less money you or your school has. At any moment they could pull the plug on the free tier, or Microsoft could put more limitations on Bing like they already have (the original release of it was much more willing to do anything) but with open source AI the opposite is true. It's only going to cost less to use as we figure out more ways to optimize it, and the gap between it and the proprietary AIs will only get smaller.",,
784152369782749,786527299545256,"Austin Halsey, yes! It is quite worrisome. But also interestingly enough, it seems that it can also help bridge some gaps? Recently had a conversation with a teacher who was interested in its potential to make certain educational materials accessible in remote areas as books are hard to come by. Long story, but it's potential use case with the help of some funding from foundations. She and I have yet to finish this conversation, but yes, I never thought that AI could possibly ""democratize intelligence"" (as one computer scientist put it!) and access to education.

Also, another thing I've been thinking about is how to use this limitation to our advantage (especially once the ""freemium"" and paid subscriptions roll out!)‚Äìit can be a way to force intentionality and ""gamify"" critical thinking even more than ChatGPT has inadvertently done so (with bad prompts equating to bad answers, students now have to think: how do i ask better questions to get better answers?)

Definitely not trying to defend the digital divide, but just also exploring the other aspects of what it brings.

Lastly, this is also why, despite the hype and promise of AI, I believe educators are here to stay (and for many reasons!). But regarding your post specifically, I agree that while AI will affect the world at scale, not everyone will feel its benefits the way those who have full access to AI do. That's why all the more governments, institutions, and educators must ensure that children are put first and learning is accessible.",,

I'm unsure of the specific use of the image you need, though having an artistic style could help the generation process.

Ask ChatGPT:

Hi ChatGPT, I am interested in using the Bing AI image generator to make artwork, painting or drawing of family unions of different cultures for my ESL lessons. However, I have not had much luck generating the bet prompt. Can you create three Bing AI image generator prompt to generate a painting, drawing, or artwork of different style showing events that a family unit celebrates together? Please ensure the prompt is specific enough so the faces are not distorted; I like to be natural.

Result:

Certainly! I can help you create specific prompts for the Bing AI image generator to generate images showing events that a family unit celebrates together. Here are three prompts you can use:

Prompt 1:
""Generate an image depicting a multicultural family enjoying a festive Thanksgiving dinner together. The family members, consisting of grandparents, parents, and children, are seated around a beautifully set table. They are smiling, laughing, and sharing a delicious meal. The scene is warm and inviting, with autumn decorations, a roasted turkey, and various traditional dishes specific to their cultures.""

Prompt 2:
""Create an image showcasing a diverse family celebrating a joyful birthday party. The scene features parents, siblings, and relatives gathered in a brightly decorated living room. The family is singing 'Happy Birthday' while presenting a cake adorned with candles to the birthday person. They are wearing colorful party hats, blowing party horns, and exchanging presents. The atmosphere is filled with happiness, love, and excitement.""

Prompt 3:
""Generate a heartwarming image illustrating a multicultural family gathering for a religious holiday celebration. The family, representing different cultures, is dressed in traditional attire, creating a vibrant and visually striking scene. They are engaged in various activities, such as decorating a Christmas tree, lighting Hanukkah candles, or offering prayers. The atmosphere is serene, with soft lighting, warm smiles, and a sense of unity and togetherness.""

Feel free to adjust the prompts as per your specific requirements. These prompts should provide enough detail to generate natural and pleasant images of family celebrations across different cultures using the Bing AI image generator.",,

Since the advent of spell-checker, have people gotten worse at spelling? Or is it just the case that a lot of people who struggled with spelling previously are now producing better-spelled (if still sometimes errorful) documents? And does having that tool save their mental energy to be put into other aspects of their writing?

My answer to those questions is: I think it just makes spelling less of an issue and reduces the ableism that comes with how one was judged by one‚Äôs ability to spell correctly. I see the potential for this new wave of language tools and generative language models to be similarly rewarding in leveling some playing fields and bringing more people into the position where they can create what they need to, in less time.

I also think we have placed less of an emphasis on learning to spell because everyone just assumes there will be spellchecker. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è not quite sure how that translates here to this situation but i am sure we will see some shifts as people integrate this tech into their lives: maybe less of an emphasis on writing and more on thoughts and ideas and asking good questions?

How do you demonstrate that? Well, let's say that students are taught a project-based assessment model. The assessment always comes in 3 parts: planning (evidence of authenticity), the project itself (evidence of engagement) and critical reflection (evidence of achievement). Students are taught to use evidence from their assessment project to determine which of the graduate skills they have demonstrated in their work. Then say, their teacher, or even two teachers, have to sign off that they agree with the students' self-assessment
and that the student has evidenced those skills through that assessment project.

This list is then compiled into a graduate portfolio. That list is then easily accessible and functional for both employers and academic institutions to judge hiring qualities or if students suit the programs they've applied for.

It makes cultural bias MUCH more transparent as well. Which skills are being valued and privileged.",,

To create a slideshow from photos stored in a Google Drive folder, you can use the Google Slides API in combination with an AI solution. Here's a general approach you can follow:

1. Enable the Google Slides API: Go to the Google Developers Console (console.develop
ers.google.com), create a new project, and enable the Google Slides API.

2. Set up authentication:
Generate API credentials (OAuth 2.0 client ID) and download the corresponding JSON file. This file will be used for authentication when accessing the Google Slides API.

3. Choose an AI solution: There are various AI solutions available that can assist you in creating a slideshow from photos. For example, you can use computer vision APIs to analyze the images, extract relevant information, and generate slide content automatically.

4. Authenticate with the AI solution: Follow the documentation or guidelines provided by the AI solution to authenticate and obtain the necessary access credentials or API keys.

5. Write a script or use a programming language: Use a programming language of your choice (such as Python) to write a script that interacts with the Google Slides API and the AI solution.

6. Access the Google Drive folder: Use the Google Drive API to access the desired folder and retrieve the list of photos.

7. Process the photos with the AI solution: For each photo, send it to the AI solution's API to extract relevant information or generate slide content. This could include image recognition, text extraction, sentiment analysis, or any other relevant features provided by the AI solution.

8. Create slides using the Google Slides API: Use the extracted information from the AI solution to create slides programmaticall
y using the Google Slides API. You can set the layout, add images, text, and other elements as required.

9. Generate the slideshow: Combine the created slides into a single slideshow presentation using the Google Slides API.

10. Save or export the slideshow: Save the generated slideshow presentation to your Google Drive or export it to a desired format (e.g., PowerPoint, PDF) using the Google Slides API.

It's important to note that the exact implementation details and code will depend on the specific AI solution you choose and the programming language you prefer. The documentation and resources provided by the Google Slides API and your chosen AI solution should help you with the technical details.",,

But i agree with your point about using actual classroom discussion to grow students critical thinking skills.

But oh well. This is going to improve so much about society. I cant tell you how much knowledge I've gained perusing ChatGPT or how much more efficient it's made tedious aspects of my life. Let's make it so our focus is on reading skills, critical thinking skills, debate skills, scientific inquiry and research, etc. Let the skill of writing from scratch take a back seat. Teach, instead, creative writing and elevating writing. God, our kids need to be able to identify bullsh*t and poor logic more than they need to be able to write from scratch.

One of the courses I took was one by Lindsay Ann Learning (the title was something like hacking grading or something like that). It was the only course I felt okay with paying out of pocket even if I did not actually use it as I had systems to think about and I wasn't about to experiment on it without my school's permission. This was because I was interested in looking for real alternatives (not just promising ones that end up being surface level solutions) that could help with saving time and focus on giving helpful comments.

Pre-ChatGPT, I felt that her course was one of the most comprehensive courses on thinking about ways to streamline the grading process with the help of technology. With ChatGPT, I wonder if she's adapted her system. If it hasn't been adapted, then I think what can happen is that teachers can take the philosophy behind it and find ways to use it alongside ChatGPT. But really, it's all about intentionality and presence when giving feedback.

At the end of the day, technology can only do so much, but I believe that it's a good start.

Based on the books I've read, there's really a need to rethink the way we assess and grade overall‚Äîand it seems like the type of work that will take decades re: the shift of mindsets. But then that's another discussion for another day.",,

783206353210684,783361203195199,"It's rather intriguing, even humorous at times, to see some educators struggling with the idea of incorporating technology into their classrooms. Skepticism about the trustworthiness
of AI platforms such as ChatGPT is quite natural, and we should definitely question it. Is it completely unreliable? In which ways? Do concerns stem from the fact that its knowledge base only extends to May 12th, 2021? If that's the case, it's a bit disheartening to witness such viewpoints.

The apprehension seems to stem from a deeper, subconscious fear: the anxiety about technology, or AI specifically, usurping the human role in the realm of education. Dear teachers, we must acknowledge that if we don't adjust and learn how to weave these technological advancements into our teaching fabric, we might be nudging reality towards that fear.

It's of utmost importance that we learn to diversify and differentiate our teaching methodologies - tailoring our lessons, our lesson plans, and most importantly, tuning in to the distinctive learning styles of our students. It's not about resisting the oncoming technological wave; it's more about learning to surf it.

If concerns about students cheating are cropping up, it might be helpful to introspect how the academic environment could be contributing to such tendencies. Our goal should be to cultivate a learning atmosphere that encourages students to genuinely engage and learn on their own, instead of seeking shortcuts. Let's wholeheartedly welcome the tech evolution in education.

Remember that you can continually update ChatGPT with new information. You can then lean on its generally reliable responses to assist you in your teaching endeavors.",,

University will most likely adapt faster and with stricter evaluation to the presence of ChatGPT and other AI language models impacting education. I suspect there will soon be a mighty crash in the halls of academia when incoming students are overcome with difficulties adapting to whatever new assessment model ends up being used.

I am happy with the results from this basic approach. Anything more complicated yielded unsatisfactory results (wrong names, fake quotes, too much praise, not enough praise, missing criteria, wrong formats, etc.). Simplifying the Assistant‚Äôs tasks and allowing it freedom to generate more genetic feedback seemed to work very often distantly.

My problem initially was that I was trying to get the AI to do ‚Äúteacher replacement‚Äù work instead of ‚Äúassistant‚Äù work. It absolutely cannot (yet) produce the type of complex, specific, systematic, relational, evaluative, and holistic feedback I was trying to engineer with my prompts.
