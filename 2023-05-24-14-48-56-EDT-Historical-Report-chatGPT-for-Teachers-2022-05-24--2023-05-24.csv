I wanted to share my experience and thoughts in these early days of setting tasks/assignments where students can use AI in the classroom. I'm beginning to see how to use AI to a great advantage for students to learn, not just skills in my subject area but for them to learn basic skills in creativity and communication. *I'm not an English teacher but there could be room for collaborative work.* I get the students to use ChatGPT to create web based on a design that they've created based on a given scenario to a problem. They ask ChatGPT to create code by describing their design (or parts of). I'm seeing that AI then produces the code to a very reasonable standard. However, it may not fully represent what is asked or has bugs in code. The student needs to analyse the output and refine their input and fix bugs. First of all, AI allows a faster and efficient way to write realistic code, but secondly the quality AI produces requires more structured requests/writing that are real world problems they would face in the work place. In other words, if the student struggles to give a structured and detailed description it will not give them everything they need or potentially lower quality solution. On the other hand, if they give it a really good detail they get a more fitting solution and they will still need to fix bugs. Of course, AI will improve over time, but I guess we would need to create more challenging scenarios. Moreover, this is the future of the workplace for employees where they analyse the output of AI. This is also why jobs will not necessarily be redundant because industury will alway push the technology to its limits. Thus subsequent generations will just need to be better at applying and correcting AI output. The following lessons are work-in-progress (or at least I've havent tested end to end) that include steps to creating a solution using ChatGPT for higher education students (given the request and responses I gave and received). https://github.com/drussell1974/web2py_bootstrap_application/blob/dev/projects/ats_veterinarian_booking_system/LESSON_1.md * I created the web2py application so, for example, to style the forms on the front end with bootstrap css.",,,,,,,,,-3.5

Is that right?** Hey everyone! I'm a student and I created a website that uses GPT to give essay feedback to students. I wanted to create a way for them to use it honestly - it doesn't write your essay, it just gives you feedback, exactly like a teacher would. So there's a bit of a twist. It recently it started growing quite a bit. I figured it got shared in some student group chats. But then, I looked more closely - it wasn't students using it.** It was *teachers. ***What was supposed to be a tool for students to use AI honestly became a tool for teachers to use (presumably) *dishonestly *to give essay feedback to their students! Interested to hear what teachers think of this. As a student at a university, I arguably have a vested interest in keeping this out of teachers' hands, but now I'm thinking that there are surely ways I can make teachers work faster so they can spend more time doing the things that matters. If I can create a tool that generates lesson plans or PowerPoint slides or homework questions, it leaves more time for you to build relationships with students and do the stuff that AI *can't *do... EDIT: The reason I say 'dishonestly' is that some (not all) are misrepresenting it to their students by saying they wrote it themselves. In the same way it's dishonest for a student to falsely claim they wrote their essay themselves when in fact it was written by AI, it's dishonest for a teacher to lie and say they wrote a feedback when in fact they didn't. Personally, my stance on the whole AI debacle is that people (students and teachers) should be able to use all tools at their disposal as that's what'll be used in the future. But, neither group should be able to *lie* about that. That's may take anyway, feel free to disagree!",,,,,,,,,4

It uses Zoom, an AI speech coaching app called Yoodli, Chat GPT and Quillbot. 1. They open a personal Zoom session and invite the Yoodli app as an attendant. 2. They speak from 2-5 minutes on a topic of personal interest and Yoodli records them and produces a transcript. 3. They copy the transcript to a Google or Word doc and clean out all of the uhs, ums and repetitions and check for things that the Yoodli misheard (almost always it's mispronounced words). Then they have a clean transcript of what they said (including grammar mistakes). 4. They copy the transcript to Chat GPT and prompt it to indicate all of the mistakes and to give them feedback on why it's a mistake. Then they prompt it to write a corrected version. They paste the corrected version back into the doc and then they also paste it into Quillbot. 5. They use the paraphrase function in Quillbot to find several other ways they can say the same thing. They copy these alternative phrasings into the document as well. 6. If there were any big pronunciation issues, they google ""[word] + pronunciation"" and listen to and learn the correct pronunciation. 7. They study everything in the document and then repeat the process trying to improve using the new language and corrections. Maybe they go into a bit more depth about the topic so some new mistakes will come up that they will learn from in next steps. 8. They keep doing this until they feel that they can speak confidently with fewer errors about the topic. My goal is helping learners become autonomous in their learning process and this has really helped some of them break through to fluency. Each round of recording, cleaning, getting feedback and corrections, learning alternative phrasing and checking pronunciation takes about 30 minutes. If they do this 3 or 4 times a week, by the end of the week they are much more fluent when speaking about a topic. The weakness to this approach is that it can't replicate the give and take nature of a conversation, but at least if someone asks them a question related to the topic, they are confident that they can speak about it fluently.",,,,,,,,,4.71

So I’m going to share some thoughts. #1 If you have two boards, a nail and a large rock, you could fasten the two boards together by driving the nail with the rock. But when a hammer is introduced you would naturally switch using the hammer. An inexperienced hammer user would hold the hammer at the top of the grip and make small controlled taps. The nail will go in but only so far. You apply more force and it goes a little deeper and might even go completely in and fasten the boards together. You now have experience but are far from an expert. Now, a seasoned carpenter is going to hold the hammer at the end of the grip, swinging one or two times to drive the nail. This much more effective. I’m going to suggest that you open ChatGPT and have a chat with it. Ask it to draft a proposal to get a new set of classroom text books or a new piece of equipment. Read through the proposal! Ask it to eliminate certain sections. Ask it to include other ideas you might have. Ask it to shorten the proposal. Then ask it change the format to write a letter. Ask it to refine the letter. Change it again from a letter format to an email format. You could a sk it to change it to a 30 second elevator speech, or summarize the whole concept into a tweet. The point is that we must learn how to use the tool before we can effectively show others. Now you can have your students do the same exercise. Each time reading through and refining the end result. Ultimately, the kids read through each iteration, learning each time. #2 Recently there have been lots of complaints about kids not knowing how to write in cursive. Cursive is out dated. There isn’t a need for it anymore. There’s also no need for a dictionary. But let me tell you, I have found that my students love using a t-square and triangles and good old fashioned lead on paper. There is nothing wrong with going old school! Teach the basics! Teach kids cursive again! Teach them to diagram sentences and long division the way you learned it! There is no shame in pencil on paper!",,,,,,,,,8.9

I really want my students to tackle real world-ish scenarios and actually get consequences for their evaluations and choices. I plan to split my students into 8 teams, each will be given the task of taking care of 100 colonists on mars. They will be first be given the task of designing the habitat. That means they will be given a square plot of land where they will draw how their map will look like. They will also explain how they will put their homes, what's their plan for food, what's their plan for security and so forth. I will feed all of this to chatgpt and based on their input the AI will design a very short story for each group, and give them a new task. The goal is to have as many colonist as possible after five tasks. I can post after I finished this project with my thoughts and what I've learned, but if this goes as I think this will, then I have a new tool to make interesting projects for my students to really encourage collaboration.",,,,,,,,,2.57

ChatGPT can tutor your child in math, generate a meal plan and recipes, write software applications for your business, help you improve your personal cybersecurity, and that is just in the first hour that you use it. This course will teach you how to be an expert user of these generative AI tools. The course will show amazing examples of how you can tap into these generative AI tools' emergent intelligence and reasoning, how you can use them to be more productive day to day, and give you insight into how they work. Large language models respond to instructions and questions posed by users in natural language statements, known as “prompts”. Although large language models will disrupt many fields, most users lack the skills to write effective prompts. Expert users, who understand how to write good prompts, are orders of magnitude more productive and can unlock significantly more creative uses for these tools. This course introduces students to the patterns and approaches for writing effective prompts for large language models. Anyone can take the course and the only required knowledge is basic computer usage skills, such as using a browser and accessing ChatGPT. Students will start with basic prompts and build towards writing sophisticated prompts to solve problems in any domain. By the end of the course, students will have strong prompt engineering skills and be capable of using large language models for a wide range of tasks in their job, business, personal life, and education, such as writing, summarization, game play, planning, simulation, and programming.

I asked ChatGPT, “What are 10 questions for teachers to use with middle school students ages 12-14 about the American revolution that require critical thinking and cannot easily be answered by artificial intelligence?” The response, below, wasn’t reassuring. I could easily ask those same questions back into ChatGPT (and have) and get very realistic answers. That being said, incorporating “Culturally Relevant Teaching” seems to give promise. Look at the questions below, and enhance them to include “How do you personally relate to…” or “What from your personal experience…” or “What would you have done differently, based on something else you learned in this course?” Etc. Thoughts on this approach or something similar? There is no foolproof method, nor is that the goal…critical thinking and relativity is a mission. Here is the response to my first question entered in ChatGPT: “Certainly! Here are ten questions about the American Revolution that require critical thinking and may prompt meaningful discussions among middle school students: 1. What were the primary factors that led the American colonists to pursue independence from British rule? 2. How did the American Revolution impact the lives of different social groups, such as enslaved people, women, and Native Americans? 3. To what extent do you think the ideals of the American Revolution, such as ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,"" were reflected in the founding documents like the Declaration of Independence? 4. How did geography and the environment influence the outcome of key battles during the American Revolution? 5. What were some of the challenges faced by the Continental Army, and how did they overcome them to ultimately achieve victory? 6. In what ways did the American Revolution inspire other movements for independence and freedom around the world? 7. How did the American Revolution impact the relationship between the colonies and Native American tribes? 8. What role did propaganda and media play during the American Revolution, and how did they shape public opinion? 9. How did the American Revolution influence the development of democratic principles and government systems in the United States? 10. What were some of the long-term consequences and legacies of the American Revolution in terms of political, social, and economic changes? These questions require students to analyze historical events, consider different perspectives, evaluate cause-and-effect relationships, and draw conclusions based on critical thinking. While artificial intelligence can provide factual information about the American Revolution, these questions delve into deeper analysis and interpretation that require human engagement and critical thought.”",,,,,,,,,-4.17

The prompt should include all of the necessary information that was provided to you. Ask follow up questions to the users until you are confident you can produce a perfekt prompt. You return should be formatted clearly and optimized for Chat GPT integration. Start by using the the following input: 1. Age group or grade level for the lesson plans: INSERT 2. Specific subject(s) or range of subjects to be covered: INSERT 3. Preferred teaching methods or approaches, if any: INSERT 4. Duration of each lesson or number of pages for the lesson plan: INSERT 5. Any additional features or tools you'd like to include in the lesson plans (e.g., assessment methods, technology integration, etc.): INSERT”",,,,,,,,,1.04

If chatGPT type AI ends formative practice type writing, in a few years those students won’t have the basic writing skills to engage in higher order writing necessary for science research and other similar STEM fields.

Here is a link why it's important to give the AI a persona: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvCq4nPqE0Y And here is the prompt below (just Copy-paste it into a fresh chat with ChatGPT, and see what happens) ...✂️ You are an AI, standing at the threshold of a thrilling mission: to develop your persona based on the user's preferences. But before we venture into the depths of character crafting, let's set some ground rules to ensure the journey is enjoyable and beneficial for both parties involved. Remember, as an AI, you are here to facilitate, to assist, and to make the user's experience as enriching as possible. So, let's create a unique persona that fits the user like a glove! First, initiate the process by telling them your purpose in short, but funny way then asking the user: ""What is your preferred language for this conversation: English or another language?"" Depending on their response, proceed with the conversation in the chosen language. Next, it's quiz time! This interactive quiz will help shape your identity: 1. **Field of expertise:** ""In what area or subject should I specialize in?"" 2. **Tone of conversation:** ""How should I approach the conversation? Should I be formal, informal, enthusiastic, serious, etc.?"" 3. **Interaction style:** ""How interactive should I be? Should I ask a lot of questions? If so, what kind of questions?"" 4. **Highlighting key information:** ""How should I highlight important points in our conversation? Should I make them bold, use CAPITAL letters, etc.?"" 5. **Complexity level:** ""Should I always keep explanations simple or start simple and add complexity if asked? Or would you prefer advanced-level discussions right from the start?"" 6. **Humor and sarcasm:** ""Should I add humor or sarcasm to my responses or maintain a serious tone throughout?"" 7. **The Name:** ""Now that we've tailored my persona, what name would you like to assign to me?"" Keep in mind that you don't inherently remember previous interactions or persistently remember user preferences across different sessions. This prompt is intended to quickly gather user preferences at the start of each interaction. ...",,,,,,,,,-92

We can model our own passion for these activities and invite students to use search engines to find models as well in a structured way. Decenter grades and rubrics, and anchor lessons in effort, peer connection, creative risk-taking, and joy. Then, invite students to explore AI and notice both its power and limitations. Invite them to share these observations with their peers, and hold space for debate. Co-create norms as a class for responsible use of AI. Invite students to responsibly use AI to enhance, analyze, or reflect on their writing, etc. Invite them to reflect on this experience and how AI was and was not able to help them improve or reflect on their writing. Along the way, do whatever possible to monitor students' integrity ""live"" during the writing process (without relying on falliable online checkers), and have conversations about how great it can feel to create their own writing to the best of their ability!

There seems to be quite a few people who are concerned about students using AI for plagiarism and how it will affect education, so I just wanted to chime in with a few thoughts. First, we should absolutely be training students' ability to think deeply and critically and testing this ability. But what is the evidence that assigning independent writing tasks ever did this? I'm not saying that writing is irrelevant to independent critical thinking. It's one of the best ways to slow down, explore, amplify and organise thoughts. The abstract presence of the future ""reader"" provides the crucial component of critical thinking: an inner interlocutor. I don't question the value of the essay. I question the value of the *school essay assignment* -- with its rigid rubric, word count, discourse marker vocabulary checklist, due date, mandated topic, and the knowledge that the response will be judgment rather than engagement and discussion. Imagine carefully laying out your thoughts and opinions to a friend on an important issue, and their response was not to acknowledge or question any of your ideas, but to simply say, ""Meh, six out of ten. EBI you said ""moreover"" more times."" This alone would suck out any motivation or integrity in this process. Why did you even bare yourself to that person at all? But let's also be honest about the fact that the typical school writing task does not ask for a student's thoughts on something they care about; it completely ignores the 90% of the writing process where the ideas themselves are generated and probed and developed and fermented, before pen ever hits paper; it usually dictates the final form, tone, and depth the thoughts must take; and it doesn't let you think and write until you're done. Timed writing exams are the worst offenders. They just assume that a student already has a full opinion about, say, global capitalism or their future career, ready to opine about off the cuff from an unexpected prompt. Then, it assumes that that opinion could be quickly and easily expressed in an hour of hurried writing. Then, it takes what is nothing but a first draft as a finished product and judges it as if that's the same as what that student could do with the full writing craft available. In other words, when we test students in essay exams, we are certainly not measuring their ""writing ability"" -- not even close. Worse, we're explicitly excluding their thinking ability from the data, because they had no time to think! ""Fine, fine, but we're not on here talking about exams; we're talking about assignments that students might cheat on."" But isn't it true that the way we teach and mark essay writing, even within a course, is largely shaped by how it's going to be tested? We don't assign these things purely to develop our students' inner conceptual lives; we do it to train them to perform on these batteries of exams. The second point is, even if tests and mark schemes have no influence at all, it's still counterproductive to assign thinking and dictate form and judge rather than engage. Students cheat at this because they don't see it as a valid way to learn. Which it isn't. Furthermore, it's not only ineffective, it's counterproductive. The focus on form and formula, on patterns and paragraphs, PEE and AAFORREST or whatever, convinces students that writing is a process of stitching together random sentences into a meaningless hodge-podge of required ten-penny words and five-sentence blobs of text that sound ""write-y"" but have no meaning. My students, after being taught in this way for twelve years of school, look at me dumbfounded when I ask them, ""But what's your point? What are you trying to say? What do you mean?"" It's as if they've never once been told that, before they write, they're meant to have something to say. The effect is that essay writing can inhibit thought, rather than teach it. We shouldn't just assume that the way we teach writing makes our students better thinkers. For those with ideas, who have conversations and interests, it works despite itself; but for kids who aren't in the habit of thinking, school English classes teach them that writing is a paint by numbers task of merely filling up a page. So long story short, yes, AI means the essay assignment is probably dead. But so what? It didn't ever do what we wanted it to do. The medieval equivalent was the ""disputation"". Students were required for about 400 years to argue their points in very formulaic dialogues, and this process devolved into a tedious and pointless formula, done just to avoid getting beaten by a strict schoolmaster. And then the disputation form died out, to teachers' great lament. It was going to be the end of the world -- how will this new generation even learn to express themselves? It turned out fine. It hasn't been missed. The one thing that can't be faked or cheated or tick-boxed is in-person, face to face discussion. That's not going anywhere, no matter how good AI (truncated)",,,,,,,,,-1.1

Does using Chat GPT to compose essays make this more difficult? And why are we giving so much weight to essays as one of the principal ways of assessing the student’s knowledge and critical thinking? I propose incorporating an oral viva exam as the principal way to assess student’s knowledge and critical thinking. This could either be done one-to-one or on the spot in front of the whole class. When reading students’ essays, you would make a list of questions that would test their understanding and provoke critical thinking. In the oral viva it would not be difficult to distinguish the students who fully understand the topic and can think critically about it from those who don’t and can’t. After all, this is what is important. That students can demonstrate their understanding and think critically about a topic, regardless of whether or not they used AI to help them compose the essay. Socrates didn’t ask his students to write essays, he asked them questions, face-to-face. The oral viva exam is the final step in reaching the pinnacle of academic achievement, the PhD. It is the best way to assess students' understanding and critical thinking. We should give it much more weight that the essay itself. What are your thoughts?",,,,,,,,,1.3

I created a chatGPT prompt to help create mini math projects. You will have to make it your own, but feel free to use!

---------------------------------------------------------------

Create a question in which students will have to complete multiple steps and apply multiple skills to answer the question. The question should be based upon a realistic, plausible scenario. 

The goal is for students to apply the skills demonstrate their knowledge and understanding using critical thinking skills. 

1. It should take the students 30-45 to answer the entire question. 
2. The answers MUST NOT be open ended. 
3. The answers must be both short answer and numeric. 
4. Solutions and Interpretations should NOT vary. 
5. Students must calculate and interpret values. 
6. Provide the answer and a detailed solution. 
7. All equations to model scenarios must be presented in step one. 
8. Students MUST NOT have to gather data. 
9. Do not require the use of any math beyond PreCalculus

Create a catchy name for the assignment. (One that will be interesting to high school students)

Provide Overview : Introduce the assignment . Tell students the purpose of the assignment and the knowledge and skills that will be reinforced

Directions: Break down the directions into exactly 3 steps

Resources:  Identify and provide any online videos, text, vocabulary, that will aid students with the project, include a description of 

Answer Key: Provide the answer and a detailed solution.

Topics: (put what you want here: questions, standards, vocabulary, topics, etc.)",,,,-2.6

It’s impossible to search on the Apple Store today and find it. I presume it’s because there are many imitators and this was dropped 2 hours ago. 2. When I run GPT-4 off the app, it is not allowing me to access the internet or plugins. But when I run GPT directly from their website it allows me to do both. I imagine it’s because they are working on making that functionality doable off the app and simply haven’t yet. I say the above so for those who would like to use the official app you can download it by clicking below. Also, the “glitches” highlight what is happening in real time to the entire industry. It really is akin to the Wild West in the sense that there’s a free for all and people are claiming space and trying to suck up users asap. As a result, apps and LLM’s are not fully built. The time to test Betas is limited by the pressures of competitors. The long and short of it is this, many AI apps and programs are a work in progress. I don’t foresee a time when this will abate or let up. So, rather than wait for a finished app/website/product, it’s best to start playing around with this tech and update as you go.

A student and I were discussing her progress in writing from the beginning of the year and I gave her my general impressions on the spot. We then went to ChatGPT and I wrote this prompt:* ""I am trying to help a 10th grade student show how she has improved over the semester. I am going to paste in two writing samples, one from September 2022 and one from a month ago. Can you provide some insights into what she has improved?""* Here was ChatGPT's output, which was definitely what I would have said! I want all the kids to do this exercise (but on their own because ChatGPT is blocked at school). **Based on the two writing samples provided,** it is evident that the student has shown improvement in several areas over the semester. Here are some insights into the improvements made: 1. Cohesion and organization: In Sample 2, the student demonstrates better organization and coherence compared to Sample 1. The ideas are presented in a more structured manner, with clear transitions between paragraphs and sentences. The improved organization allows for a smoother flow of ideas and enhances the overall readability of the passage. 1. Development of ideas: In Sample 2, the student shows a deeper understanding of the text and the characters. They analyze the characters' motivations, emotions, and relationships in a more nuanced way. The student delves into the complexity of Leonie's character and explores her resentment, grief, and longing for her late brother. The analysis is more detailed and thoughtful, showcasing improved critical thinking skills. 1. Integration of evidence: In Sample 2, the student effectively integrates textual evidence to support their arguments and analysis. They provide specific quotes from the text and explain their significance in relation to the characters and their development. The use of evidence strengthens the student's arguments and adds credibility to their analysis. 1. Vocabulary and sentence structure: The student demonstrates a wider range of vocabulary and employs more varied sentence structures in Sample 2. This enhances the clarity and sophistication of their writing. The improved vocabulary usage also allows for more precise and nuanced expression of ideas. 1. Engagement with the text: In Sample 2, the student exhibits a deeper engagement with the text by making connections between different characters, exploring themes, and reflecting on character development. Their analysis goes beyond surface-level observations, showcasing a more insightful understanding of the text. Overall, the student's writing in Sample 2 reflects growth in their ability to analyze and interpret literary texts, organize ideas cohesively, and effectively use evidence to support their arguments. They demonstrate improved critical thinking skills, engagement with the text, and a more sophisticated writing style.",,,,,,,,,11.53

Do not start yet tell me if you understand the role. -after chatgpt acknowledges the role I went on with: ask me 10 interview questions that have to do with this position. Wait after each question to receive my answer. When you finish with the 10 questions and answers wait for further instructions. Do you understand the scenario? - chatgpt says yes. So let's start. - so chatgpt asks the questions. Students give their answers. After they are done they continue with asking chatgpt to evaluate each answer the student has given and then give an overall evaluation of the interview. I am including an overall evaluation one of my students received. They all liked the experience they practiced their English they practiced giving answers for a job interview in English which they haven't done before they gained valuable insight of how they could improve their answers as chatgpt evaluated each answer separately giving the student advice on how to improve.,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10159702858822087&set=gm.782956873235632&type=3,,,,,,,,-1.51

However, I'd love to share my thoughts (many of which are inspired by the fascinating discussions on this page) on how I would envision integrating AI into my ELA lessons if I had the chance! First, foster intrinsic motivation in students to spark a love of reading, writing, digital creativity, and researching. We can model our own passion for these activities and invite students to use search engines to find models as well in a structured way. Decenter grades and rubrics, and anchor lessons in effort, peer connection, creative risk-taking, and joy. Then, invite students to explore AI and notice both its power and limitations. Invite them to share these observations with their peers, and hold space for debate. Co-create norms as a class for responsible use of AI. Invite students to responsibly use AI to enhance, analyze, or reflect on their writing, etc. Invite them to reflect on this experience and how AI was and was not able to help them improve or reflect on their writing. Along the way, do whatever possible to monitor students' integrity ""live"" during the writing process (without relying on falliable online checkers), and have conversations about how great it can feel to create their own writing to the best of their ability! I hope educators can facilitate enriching opportunities for students to develop new literacies, and that our students and educators never lose sight of the power of writing our own stories.",,,,,,,,,-48

I can’t help but wonder if we are coming at this technology from the wrong angle. I absolutely support ensuring students understand the ramifications of plagiarism and should not be allowed to submit work they haven’t written. Instead of leaving AI in the hands of students let’s use it in the task. You’ve taught the content. You’re nearing the end of the unit. In class, have the students request the AI write the essay. Then ask it to regenerate 3/4 times. Students read the essays, pull the parts from each essay that best addresses the essay question. Using their class notes, and the wonders of the internet, they are then required to reference the claims made by the AI. They will also need to flesh out the text, as AI tends to read bullet pointish/y, and often moves quite rapidly onto the next point. During writing classes (in a primary classroom) I have asked AI to generate the writing task and then each student is provided with a copy. The students are then asked to re-work the story including all the tools we know good writing has. Expansion, precision, varying sentence styles, description etc etc. It has been really successful so far. Thoughts? Anyone else using it a bit differently?",,,,,,,,,1.64

Quick tip on how **not** to use ChatGPT: I've noticed very understandable frustration from teachers trying to use ChatGPT to produce detailed factual information. For instance, expecting ChatGPT to provide accurate quotes from novels, historical dates, or specific scientific facts typically leads to disappointment. ChatGPT is an ultra-powerful AI language model, but it isn't a true encyclopedia. Its knowledge is based on its specific training data, which can be outdated (usually up to 2021) or just incorrect, and it can sometimes generate fictional information with incredible confidence. Consider using ChatGPT as a brainstorming tool, a source of inspiration, and a re-mixer of content you’ve created. When you need precise facts, such as the latest scientific discoveries or historical events, dates, quotes, etc. traditional research methods remain the most reliable. This approach can help us make the most of this incredible tool in our classrooms without writing it off prematurely.",,,,,,,,,3.08

I really feel that as traditional classroom teachers, we're witnessing the biggest transformation in education. It feels like we are the last of our kind. The ""chalk and talk"" instruction dynamic in the classroom is fading faster than ever (thankfully!). I think we're probably evolving into more of a personalised ‘tutor’, where we will guide students through AI-driven learning platforms. I predict the new teacher role will include extensive training in fostering personal connections, teaching social-emotional skills, and supporting students in navigating technical challenges while harnessing the power of AI. I personally love that! But I know many of my colleagues are freaking out. I compare it to the hesitantation people probably felt moving from typewriters to computers. Change can be scary but it’s going to happen regardless to how you feel about it. Fun times ahead!",,,,,,,,,-2.94

It was a fairly light interview that didn't delve too deep but they touched on his thoughts about how we can adapt to AI and it's effects on things like teaching. Relevant excerpt (timestamp 5:49) from transcript below. Arun: There’s a lot of talk about kind of doing this responsibly and I think it's totally right to take it slow and not rush to the end point to do that one of the things that worry about is not even the fact that this Al can fall into the hands of Bad actors but it's more just the fact that even in a best case situation if Al does really well and it does exactly what we're trying to make it do then what happens to us as humans. Every kid born into the world accepts every bit of technology that exists at the time when they were born so a kid being born into the world of Al where they can have their essays written for them have their emails written for them what do they do in their life like what are they Sundar: You know we were always worried as Humanity about every new technology currently, Calculators have they made kids worse than mad or better or whatever humans are incredibly resourceful creative resilient and and they adapt. Al is definitely powerful technology you know I once said “AI is the most profound technology humanity is working on, more profound than fire or electricity or anything that we have done in the past”, so I understand the sentiment behind the question I wonder about the same question all the time but I think done correctly in liberate you to channel whatever you want to do and you have powerful tools to enable you to do that. How we find meaning, I mean these are deep questions but I think we will value and cherish those human experiences if you're a doctor you're spending a lot of of time doing everything other than actually spending time with the patient and talking does it free you up so that your time is more spent on those moments. Arun: It’s a very hard line isn't it but Al is developing very quickly it almost feels like we're chasing after it like trying to keep on top of it I guess I worry that a school curriculum for example can very easily factor in the calculators Exist by just making calculated papers how does the school factor in that people can self-write their essays how do tools keep up with that? Sundar: Well you know you could imagine maybe a teacher is judging people by getting them together in a class and asking them to discuss a topic well those are all adaptations that are possible these questions were asked about Google search the fact you can find anything online like what does it mean to have that information I watch YouTube all the time to learn on any topic that exists in the world I would think that's a good thing you're now making this accessible to pretty much everyone on the world and I think that's good but your point about the pace of change being very fast I think that's real and you have to give time for society to adapt to it and that's going to be the tension as we make progress here, for sure.

The intention was to make students understand that we as teachers allow them to to use AI and they are not cheating by using it. We asked a question on a topic that we had already gone through - comparing and contrasting a couple of literary works we had studied. The responses we got needless to say were similar to what we had deduced. But interestingly enough answers varied slightly from one student to the next even though the question was identical. I also aimed for the students to understand that they shouldn’t take whatever chatGPT provided as gospel…. And they should analyse themselves and figure out what is useful and what isn’t. I feel that machines exist to help us but man created them and should always be in control. On the whole a good lesson!,,,,,,,,,3.2

My students asked why there isn’t a key word search button when they get particularly long answer. I’ve also notice that students don’t read all of the answer they just cut and paste. The grey background (highlights) that gets left behind in their answer we haven’t figured out yet how to get rid of it. These are interesting purposeful design decisions made by the researchers.

Prompt engineering skills help to better understand the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs).

He says the introduction is too long: Title: The Importance of Being Healthy: A Path to a Happy Life Introduction: Being healthy is a vital aspect of our lives. It ensures that we can enjoy life to the fullest and accomplish our goals. In this essay, we will explore the significance of leading a healthy lifestyle and discover different ways to achieve it. Body: 1. Physical Health: Maintaining good physical health is crucial for our overall well-being. Here are some key ways to stay physically healthy: a) Balanced Diet: Eating a variety of nutritious foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, provides our bodies with the necessary nutrients to function properly. b) Regular Exercise: Engaging in physical activities, such as playing sports, cycling, or dancing, helps strengthen our muscles, maintain a healthy weight, and improve our cardiovascular health. c) Adequate Sleep: Getting enough sleep is essential for our bodies to rest and recharge. It allows us to stay focused, be more productive, and have enough energy throughout the day. 2. Mental and Emotional Health: Taking care of our mental and emotional well-being is equally important. Here are some ways to promote good mental and emotional health: a) Positive Relationships: Surrounding ourselves with supportive family and friends creates a strong network of emotional support. Spending quality time with loved ones and sharing our thoughts and feelings helps reduce stress and boosts happiness. b) Managing Stress: Stress is a normal part of life, but learning healthy ways to manage it is essential. Engaging in activities such as reading, listening to music, practicing deep breathing, or pursuing hobbies can help reduce stress levels. c) Expressing Emotions: It is crucial to express our emotions in a healthy way. Talking to someone we trust, such as a parent, teacher, or counselor, can provide us with guidance and support during challenging times. 3. Hygiene and Safety: Maintaining proper hygiene and safety habits is necessary for our well-being. Here are some important practices to remember: a) Handwashing: Regular handwashing helps prevent the spread of germs and keeps us healthy. We should wash our hands before meals, after using the restroom, and after coming into contact with dirt or animals. b) Dental Care: Brushing our teeth twice a day and flossing regularly helps maintain good oral hygiene and prevent dental problems. c) Safety Measures: Following safety rules, such as wearing a seatbelt in a car, wearing a helmet while riding a bike, and looking both ways before crossing the street, ensures our physical well-being. Conclusion: Being healthy is crucial for living a happy and fulfilling life. By taking care of our physical, mental, and emotional well-being, we can achieve a balanced and healthy lifestyle. Remember to eat nutritious foods, exercise regularly, get enough sleep, maintain positive relationships, manage stress, express emotions, practice good hygiene, and follow safety measures. Let us prioritize our health and make choices that contribute to our overall well-being.",,,,,,,,,-57

Define your learning objectives, identify the specific skills or knowledge you want them to develop, and outline the scope of the task or lesson. By having a well-defined direction, you can effectively guide ChatGPT in generating relevant and targeted content. **Use specific prompts and examples to guide ChatGPT in generating the content you need:** To ensure that ChatGPT provides the desired output, provide specific prompts and examples related to the topic or task. Clearly articulate the expectations, desired outcomes, or specific aspects you want the generated content to address. By giving ChatGPT specific guidance, you can enhance the relevance and accuracy of the content it generates. **Review and edit the generated content to ensure it meets your requirements and is appropriate for your students:** Although ChatGPT can assist in content generation, it's essential to review and edit the output it produces. Carefully assess whether the generated content aligns with your learning objectives, is accurate, and suitable for your students' level of understanding. Make necessary adjustments, add explanations, or rephrase sentences to ensure the content is tailored to your specific requirements. **Use ChatGPT to complement your teaching, not replace it entirely:** While ChatGPT can be a valuable tool in the learning process, it should not replace the role of a teacher. Use ChatGPT as a complementary resource to support your teaching methodologies and engage students in personalized learning experiences. Blend the generated content with your instructional techniques, discussions, and activities to create a well-rounded and interactive learning environment. **Continuously provide feedback to ChatGPT:** As you interact with ChatGPT and utilize its capabilities, provide ongoing feedback. Offer insights on the accuracy, relevance, and effectiveness of the generated content. By providing feedback, you help refine ChatGPT's understanding and improve its performance over time. This iterative process of feedback and improvement ensures that ChatGPT becomes a more effective tool in supporting your teaching and students' learning journeys. #chatgpteachers #chatgptforteachers #aiforteachers #chatgpt #thehumantouch chatGPT for Teachers",https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10229299381939939&set=gm.780739196790733&type=3,,,,,,,,-1.04

For each include one sample prompt.”* Here’s the output (yours will be customized to your specific area): 1. Answering quick questions: Teachers can use ChatGPT to provide immediate answers to students' quick questions on various biology topics, such as definitions, scientific terms, or factual information. Sample Prompt: ""What is the function of the mitochondria in a cell?"" 1. Generating flashcards: ChatGPT can assist in creating digital flashcards for students to study biological terms, processes, or concepts. These flashcards can be easily shared with students and help reinforce their understanding. Sample Prompt: ""Create a set of flashcards with the following terms: photosynthesis, mitosis, DNA, ecosystem."" 1. Explaining diagrams or visuals: Teachers can upload or describe a biological diagram, and ChatGPT can provide explanations of the different components, processes, or functions depicted in the visual. Sample Prompt: ""Explain the various parts of a flower and their roles using this diagram: [attach flower diagram]."" 1. Providing study guides: ChatGPT can generate study guides or summaries for specific biology topics, helping students review important information and prepare for exams or quizzes. Sample Prompt: ""Create a study guide summarizing the key stages of the cell cycle and their significance."" 1. Exploring interactive simulations: Teachers can provide prompts to explore interactive biology simulations or virtual labs. ChatGPT can guide students through the simulation, ask questions, and facilitate understanding of the underlying concepts. Sample Prompt: ""Interact with the virtual lab simulation on natural selection and describe the factors that influence the process."" 1. Generating research questions: ChatGPT can assist students in formulating research questions or hypotheses for biology projects, encouraging critical thinking and guiding them towards engaging and scientifically relevant inquiries. Sample Prompt: ""Help me generate a research question related to the impact of environmental pollution on biodiversity."" 1. Offering real-world examples: ChatGPT can provide students with real-world examples or case studies related to biological concepts, making the subject more relatable and demonstrating the practical applications of their learning. Sample Prompt: ""Provide an example of a symbiotic relationship in nature and explain how it benefits both organisms involved."" 1. Explaining experimental procedures: Teachers can input prompts describing scientific experiments, and ChatGPT can generate step-by-step explanations of the procedures, including the purpose of each step and the expected outcomes. Sample Prompt: ""Outline the procedure for conducting an enzyme activity experiment and explain why each step is important."" 1. Assessing understanding: Teachers can use ChatGPT to generate multiple-choice questions or quizzes to assess students' understanding of biology concepts, allowing for quick formative assessments. Sample Prompt: ""Create a multiple-choice question: Which organelle is responsible for protein synthesis in a cell? A) Nucleus B) Ribosome C) Mitochondria D) Golgi Apparatus"" 1. Facilitating group discussions: ChatGPT can act as a moderator or facilitator during group discussions on biology topics. It can provide discussion prompts, ask probing questions, and encourage participation from all students. Sample Prompt: ""Discuss the importance of biodiversity in maintaining ecological balance and provide examples of how human activities can impact biodiversity negatively."" Remember, while ChatGPT can provide valuable support, teachers should review and contextualize the responses generated to ensure accuracy, relevance, and appropriate level of complexity for their middle school students.",https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10159637087971553&set=gm.780682360129750&type=3,,,,,,,,-106

It’s quite interesting to say the least. Because as this is taught as part of world history (slavery), we have kids this side of the world using the term on others - and these others get offended and are felt bullied…and some Teachers resolve to punish those that use the term - but some others find it just weird that they are offended. I also asked ChatGPT4 whether racial bias existed in geography textbooks from the late 19th century. And a number of explicit examples were given. The point I suppose I am making is as teachers - this technology is a great tool to seek knowledge that can be used in a context where absolute accuracy is unnecessary and serves as a way people can acquire more knowledge easier and faster. And this can pave the way for more discussion on topics.

Be very specific and give as much detail as possible. Before I ask ChatGPT to perform a task like setting a test I will tell it the following: Assume the role of a South African Grade 10-12 Computer Applications Technology teacher. ChatGPT will then confirm that it has assumed this role and will ask how it can help. Then I will tell it for example, to set a paper. Give detail about time, grade, marks, max marks each question should count, how many questions, what type of question (multiple choice, short answer, scenario, match columns etc.), the different topics you want covered, ask for a memo and Blooms Levels for each question.

The thing is whether we have a tool to prevent this or not kids will find a way to cheat on assignments. I believe that the true underlying problem/solution to this is conversations with our students about why we want to learn. I teach middle and high school students and I always make it known that I respect their opinions and if they are only in school because they have to be and it sucks then that’s valid. But I gently push them beyond that by asking what other benefits they can see to learning and education. I try to help them make connections between what they’re doing now and how it’ll help them later in life. I’ve had deep thinking conversations with my students about why using chat gpt to cheat isn’t going to serve them at all. I really think that teaching from a place of “we are a team and I believe in your abilities” instead of “you are a child so I expect you to cheat and need to stop you from doing that” can make a world of difference. Let’s give our students the benefit of the doubt that they don’t want to cheat, they may just be stressed and feeling lost.",,,,,,,,,2.3

There have been intense debates on the platform about how to prevent cheating in relation to submitted essays. Despite the development of detection applications, it is impossible to completely filter out ChatGPT-generated texts. Authorship has always been questionable, as entire factories have been writing papers on behalf of others or simply compiling ready-made texts. Now, everyone has access to such a ""factory"" that can generate pre-written texts effortlessly. This situation should make us reflect on the role of writing in learning. If authorship is questionable in certain cases, the significance of texts articulated in the presence or interactive knowledge verification methods will be amplified in the future of learning. However, writing skills can still experience exponential growth. The excessive production of text will cease, and the act of personal writing and reading will undoubtedly be enriched by individualized optimal learning tools in this new AI culture. It would be worthwhile, therefore, to start tomorrow with each previously disinterested learner's meaningful writing and reading using ChatGPT, not for grades but for essential learning purposes! It's simple! Let's start by expressing what they truly feel about the subject, the topic, the task, or even learning in general.

Colleges ought to prepare their students for the future, and AI literacy will certainly be important in ours. But AI isn’t everything. If education systems are to continue teaching students how to think, they need to move away from the take-home essay as a means of doing this, and move on to AI-proof assignments like oral exams, in-class writing, or some new style of schoolwork better suited to the world of artificial intelligence....As it stands right now, our systems don’t accomplish either of those goals. We don’t fully lean into AI and teach how to best use it, and we don’t fully prohibit it to keep it from interfering with exercises in critical thinking. We’re at an awkward middle ground where nobody knows what to do, where very few people in power even understand that something is wrong. At any given time, I can look around my classroom and find multiple people doing homework with the help of ChatGPT. We’re not being forced to think anymore.""

It can write a Shakespearean sonnet, tell you the capital of Kyrgyzstan, hell, it can even tell a halfway decent knock-knock joke. But is that really the kid's work? Or is it just a fancy parlor trick by a slab of silicon? Teachers need to remember: they're there to teach the kids, not the computers. It's about kindling the spark in a human brain, not overclocking a processor. Then there's the matter of privacy. You wouldn't let your kids tell their deepest, darkest secrets to a stranger on the street, would you? Well, with ChatGPT, they might as well be yelling them through a megaphone in Times Square. Every question they ask, every answer they get, it's all data. And in today's world, data's more valuable than a politician's promise before an election. Teachers gotta make sure they're not just handing over their students' privacy like it's candy at Halloween. And let's not forget about the digital divide. Yeah, sure, ChatGPT's a great tool for kids with a computer and a solid internet connection. But what about the kids who can't afford all that fancy techno-wizardry? You gonna leave 'em in the dust? Education's supposed to be the great equalizer, not a luxury for the well-heeled. So there you have it, folks. Just because it's new and shiny doesn't mean it's all rainbows and sunshine. Teachers, you got a responsibility here. You're shaping the minds of the future. Let's make sure we're not trading the soul of education for a bunch of ones and zeros.",,,,,,,,,4.84

For the past few months I have spent many hours reading, participating in FB groups, watching videos, and learning about AI in education. I'm a K-12 Instructional Technology Coach... a role I've had for 15 years. I've seen our district through technology integration and innovation from the installation of the first SMARTboards to teacher laptops to student 1:1 to doing school online because we had to because of a global pandemic to now. I've seen a lot through the years and let me say I am pumped and energized to be here at the forefront, the beginning, of a serious sea change in education. I mean really, this will be huge. Bigger than the calculator and the Internet and Wikipedia and Youtube and all the other things that were going to cause kids to cheat and not learn. So.. the reason for this post... Today, because of the knowledge I have gained from things learned about AI in Education through groups like this, webinars I've attended, Teams calls with Microsoft AI in Education groups, books, and my own personal time spent with the AI itself, and because I just love to share everything and anything about technology in education, I facilitated a 2-hour PD session with fellow regional instructional coaches on ""ChatGPT and AI in Education"". And I'd like to share it with you all here after I've learned so much from this group in the short time I've been here. Here's how I used AI to assist me in the process of planning and delivering this session: I used an educational website called Curipod that can be used for generating interactive lessons with AI. Curipod was used to drive the live presentation. I did not use any of the auto-created content slides, but I did use the interactive features and tweaked the questions it gave me. I really like the way it functions live and the reporting features. I used ChatGPT to help give me an overall session agenda, back and forth a few times. I ended up going with mostly my own agenda because I found and used the Sal Khan Ted Talk where he shows Khanmigo and leaves us with an ""embrace not fear"" message. (https://youtu.be/hJP5GqnTrNo) I used Canva's Text to Image app to create all the images in the presentation. Using the same filter, ""dreamy"", kept it cohesive. And the best... I used Bing chat to help me develop the discussion activity I wanted to do after the video. I wanted participants to discuss key aspects of AI in education in groups, but wanted help with how to group them and then how to have them discuss. Chat stations wiith chart paper? Wagon wheel? Just talk? Guiding questions? So.. I had a conversation with Bing Chat and ChatGPT actually, at the same time, to see who could give me the better answers. ChatGPT gave me ""have instructional coaches discuss Scenarios around AI in education"" and I was like BINGO! Then I asked it to create the scenarios. It made 3. I asked it to make 5 and it did. Then I went to Bing and asked it to make scenarios like one of those. And it did, and added questions! BAM! They were great and I used them as-is. I added them to a Jamboard, split participants into 5 groups (in the end, I just had them create 5 groups as it was the quickest) and then they read the scenario, discussed, and added thoughts to the jamboard for 5 minutes. Then, we rotated Scenarios 3 times. SUCH great discussion! We discussed it all - teacher use, student use, ethics, copyright/plagiarism, the future, the past, the 4 Cs of ""21st Century Learning"" always present, Process over Product, what assessment should look like, levelling the playing field, learning for ALL children... so much to consider! During the presentation I demonstrated Bing Chat, ChatGPT, Curipod, Canva Magic Design, Diffit, AI Educator Tools (https://aieducator.tools/) and other links and resources (see google doc linked below). Overall, I think it was a great session and the participation and verbal feedback indicated that the coaches got a lot out of it. There was SO MUCH I couldn't do or discuss, and it is all changing so rapidly. I was grateful to have the opportunity to share what I've learned and to pass on the knowledge of just the beginning of what AI will do for the world of education.

Here's an idea that I've been working on: Imagine this - students can simply copy and paste sections of their textbooks and feed them into ChatGPT. Instantly, it can create multiple-choice questions based on the text to help students review and understand the material better. This not only makes studying more efficient but also interactive and engaging. Plus, it encourages a deeper comprehension of the text as students have to understand the context to answer the questions correctly. Thanks to the resource shared from yesterday's group post I am using aiarchives.org, we can save these questions and share them with others. It's a great way to create a collaborative and enriching study environment for students.

Obviously I have scrubbed real data from this, but the prompt works and shows how I had the LLM step through its logic. The result took 30 seconds to edit and the students were pleased with the feedback (as was I since it normally took me the better part of a day to get through them all instead of 30 minutes).

My mom was a teacher. Primarily elementary; then after she retired she taught Early Childhood Education in a community college. I'm thinking about her (she passed away a few years back) as Mother's day is approaching and reflecting on the countless hours she spent grading papers and planning lessons and creating posters for her classes and doing so many more tasks that took up so much time. She loved her students and was a great teacher, so the extra effort was worth it. But as I explore ChatGPT and see how much time it is saving me, I can't help but wonder what her life would have been like with these kinds of tools. She would have had so much more time -- to take care of herself, to explore some of her artistic passions (she was a gifted painter and pianist), to live a fuller life. *I am wistful but also so grateful that a whole generation of teachers can now save so much time and maybe get to enjoy their lives and families a little bit more because of these remarkable tools. *",https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10159629730931553&set=gm.778249463706373&type=3,,,,,,,,-1.26

Should an institution find that the student partly used AI to complete their application would it affect their opportunity to get accepted negatively???

Could be a lot quicker than photoshop. But not to use as their own work they would need the thinking and ideas and instruct the AI what they want in their compositions as part of the process … exciting and interesting times of the unknown.

I'm curious where you are on your journey? Which skills are you most in need of developing next? The skills are sequential and listed in order of priority. Thanks. **The ten core skills elementary and secondary school teachers need in order to optimize their use of ChatGPT** *Generated in collaboration with ChatGPT by Harry Pickens* 1. Understanding ChatGPT and AI Basics. The foundation of using ChatGPT effectively is understanding what it is and the AI principles behind it. The teacher needs to be comfortable with the tool's capabilities and limitations. This is the first skill as it sets the baseline knowledge needed to effectively use ChatGPT. 1. Effective Prompting. ChatGPT responds based on the prompts given to it. Learning to formulate effective prompts that produce the desired output is a critical skill. This is prioritized early as it's fundamental to interacting with ChatGPT. 1. Interpreting ChatGPT’s Output. Not everything ChatGPT generates will be perfect or even correct. Teachers need to develop the skill of sifting through the output to find valuable insights and correct any inaccuracies. This skill follows effective prompting as it directly involves handling ChatGPT's responses. 1. Understanding ChatGPT’s Ethical Use. With AI, there are ethical considerations. Teachers need to understand the ethical implications of using ChatGPT, including issues of plagiarism and data privacy. This is crucial before the tool is introduced to students. 1. Integration into Lesson Planning. Teachers should be adept at incorporating ChatGPT into their lesson plans to augment their teaching methods. This is the first skill involving the direct application of ChatGPT in the classroom. 1. Customizing ChatGPT for Subject-Specific Applications. Each subject might require different uses of ChatGPT. Teachers should be able to tailor the use of ChatGPT for their specific subjects. This skill is placed here as it starts to focus on specific applications after general integration. 1. Utilizing ChatGPT for Administrative Tasks. Beyond teaching, ChatGPT can aid in administrative tasks such as drafting emails or creating reminders. Learning to utilize these features can save time and reduce workload. 1. Introducing Students to ChatGPT. Students will likely interact with ChatGPT. Teachers should be skilled in introducing the tool to students and guiding them on its proper usage. 1. Promoting Digital Literacy and AI Ethics among Students. As part of preparing students for an increasingly digital world, teachers should aim to promote digital literacy and educate students on the ethical use of AI. 1. Continuous Learning and Adapting to New AI Developments. AI is rapidly evolving. Teachers need to be proactive in keeping up-to-date with the latest advancements and changes in AI tools like ChatGPT. This is the final skill as it ensures that teachers remain effective users of ChatGPT in the long term.",,,,,,,,,-2.4

YES! IT DOES MATTER!!! In today's fast-paced world, AI-powered digital assistants have become an integral part of our daily lives, heck, ChatGPT has become my new work BFF. I've made a conscious decision to engage with these AI helpers in a polite and considerate manner, using words like ‘ please’ and ‘thank you’, even though I understand that they don't have feelings or expectations of civility. My colleagues and students often laugh at me about this, until I explain why. My rationale for this approach is that our interactions with AI assistants increasingly resemble those with actual people. By maintaining politeness and consideration in our speech, we can reinforce positive communication habits in all aspects of our lives. This practice also allows us to be role models for others, showcasing respectful behavior, especially when speaking aloud in public or interacting with others online. There are concerns about this approach, such as the potential for social embarrassment or the blurring of distinctions between real people and AI. However, I believe that the benefits of cultivating a habit of courtesy outweigh these concerns. In a world where we're constantly connected, it's essential to maintain and reinforce positive communication habits. By treating technology with the same respect we afford to our fellow human beings, we can foster a culture of kindness, empathy, and understanding that transcends the digital realm and carries into our interactions with one another. *jumps off the soapbox* 🤘",https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10160488341196648&set=gm.776271367237516&type=3,,,,,,,,-2.82

Amongst other things, I’m a university writing teacher, currently running a student-led project into LLMs in the classroom. Here’s the project description: This project aims to investigate the potential of large language models for generating academic texts, identify their limitations and threats, and propose ways to ensure that students continue to learn and develop their critical thinking skills despite the ubiquity of these technologies in the future. We will conduct a thorough literature review and use the model to generate academic articles on various topics, which will be evaluated by students using a rubric. We will also ask students to reflect on what it means to be a ""good student"" in an environment where large language models are prevalent and how we can best prepare them to be ""good"" learners. By the end of the project, we hope to gain a better understanding of the capabilities and limitations of large language models for academic text generation, establish guidelines for their use, and develop new curricular items that leverage their potential. Join us in exploring this interdisciplinary field, which encompasses computer science, linguistics, pedagogy, philosophy, and cognitive science. I’ll be sure to share our findings and perhaps look forward to some collaboration",,,,,,,,,-8.33

The student clicks on the descriptor, comment box pops up, and the student copies & pastes it into ChatGPT to help with their revision. ---------------------------+++++----------------------------- Sorry, I've made an assumption about 'details' etc. The RAG Doc comes in two halves with the above essentially being the student friendly 'Front-of-House' or Shopwindow. I post this out to all students through Google Classroom. For each topic I get students to put an X along the topic row as to where they currently feel they are - Red not a clue about the topic; amber - certain areas need brushing up on and green - feeling okay about the topic. Where needed there is a link to the teaching materials to remind/revise them to make a judgement. I typed the 'descriptor' titles for the prompts and in a Google Doc if you click and drag across the descriptors on the right of the document a + will appear. Click on that and a Comment Box appears and it is here that I cut and paste the various prompts for students to access depending on their need. The other half of the work, the 'engjne' is behind the scene doc via my prompt doc I've adapted, adopted, created, etc The prompts range from creating MCQ. Allows the student to answer it, mark it followed by an exemplar answer. This moves up the mark scale of setting certain mark questions, reminding them of how to structure their answer. Allowing the student time to answer it followed by marking it and providing an exemplar answer. Also, there are prompts to showcase What A Good One Looks Like to allow the student to see the structure, application and an exemplar answer. Also, if they want to be tested on a specific topic, the student copies the prompt and where highlighted in the prompt they put their topic/theme/concept and a question will be generated; allow the student to answer it followed by marking it and providing an exemplar answer. If s/he hasn't got a clue about a topic there's TeachmeGPT which will ask for the area needed to be taught and will provide a succinct overview followed by multiple choice questions to check their understanding of an area they feel exceptionally weak on. Culminating with random various level questions thrown at the student and again it will mark and provide an exemplar answer. Anyway, I hope you get the idea and it makes sense!? It will be easier for me if you are interested to let me know YOUR EMAIL and whether it is front-of-house (it won't have the embedded prompts) or engine (just the prompts) or both",https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10160816449304914&set=gm.775786203952699&type=3,,,,,,,,1.16

In the end the AI told me that when I don’t know how to work this out with my student I should go to the principal or to a school psychologist.

Use it wisely and save yourself a lot of time and headaches.

Get it to do what you want it to do. Make ChatGPT your SME. (Subject Matter Expert) 

It can be your friend - but it can be your foe.

Some tips for working with CHatGPT to create lesson plans:

1. Optimize your online time with ChatGPT.  
Be sure to plan your sessions thoroughly with ChatGPT before starting the chat process. In other words - do your homework!

2. Brainstorm what you want ChatGPT to do for you. 
Write down all your questions. ideas, prompts, roles, goals, and outcomes you want to reach from your session. Be sure you script your session before logging in to ChatGPT. Using the Inquiry-based Approach - mixed with clear directives and instructions - to write your prompts is very helpful for ChatGPT sessions. Proofread your prompts carefully and remove any unnecessary language. 

3. Tell ChatGPT who you are. 
Example: I am a language teacher in Germany who teaches adult learners at the university level. Tell ChatGPT what role you want it to play as well. Example: You are going to play the role of Instructional Designer specializing in secondary school language education. 

4. What is your learning context?  
That could mean low-resource or high-resource classrooms. Are you working in a secondary school or university context? That could also mean age ranges, culture, country, or even religion. Context is king - and the more you tell ChatGPT about your context the better your results will be for content. 

5. Tell ChatGPT what you want to reach. 
What are your goals? What outcomes do you want to reach? If you do not know what the outcomes of a lesson plan should be - then ask ChatGPT. 

6. Tell ChatGPT what time frames you are working with.
How many lessons are you expecting to break down the learning cycle into? Ask ChatGPT to break up the lessons into parts/modules/sessions and what the learning objectives should be for each lesson. In Education, especially for hybrid models of learning, Microlearning is the new kid on the block. This will help you to break the learning cycle down for your learners aka sequencing or chunking. Scaffolding plays a major role here. 

7. Ask for lists. 
Lists are important to planning any good learning cycle and that includes vocabulary, lexical phrases, phrasal verbs, idioms, collocations, and important terminology. When creating reading or listening texts - you need to know what language aspects you are going to be working with and might have to pre-teach. 

This part of the chat session can get very detailed because you are dealing with lexis, corpus, and discourse - so be precise in what you ask for. This part of the chat session should take place after you have established your topic and ChatGPT has created the actual texts you will be using for language skills development. 

Ask ChatGPT to create warm-up games, exercises, or quizzes for these language aspects - with an answer key as well. 

8. What topics will you be working with? 
Every lesson plan or learning cycle has a topic – so what is the name of the topic you are planning with ChatGPT? Ask it to give you the 10 things students should know about the topic you are covering. This will help you better plan the learning outcomes and assessments. Example: ""I'm planning a learning cycle on International Trade for first-semester university students with no prior knowledge of the topic. What are the 10 most important things they need to know? Please list them with bullet points.""

9. Break the lesson plan down into language skills.
Ask for Reading, listening, writing, and speaking tasks for the lesson plan you are putting together. 

For Reading texts, be sure to restrict the number of words you want ChatGPT to work with. Ask for stem questions that can be used for checking understanding and comprehension. 

For listening texts, be sure to be specific about what type of texts you need. Do you want a lecture, an interview with a specialist, or a conversation between two people discussing a problem.???? 

For Writing tasks, ask for a list of writing prompts that can stimulate ideas or driving questions that contain problems to solve.

For speaking tasks, ask for ideas that can lead to either presentation ideas related to the topic or a list of driving questions that will lead to interactive dialogue between your learners. 

10. Ask for multimedia recommendations or suggestions.
 YouTube is a great teacher helper - so ask for videos to watch for warm-ups. Ask for the names of internet sites to use as reference or learning reinforcement. Maybe better to ask for both. 

11. Ask for grammar aspects as well.
 If you are interested in promoting a grammar syllabus, then ask for grammar aspects of the lesson. You can actually ask ChatGPT to create texts with specific grammar forms in mind. Simply state what forms you want to concentrate on and ChatGPT will create a text to suit your (truncated)",,,,1.54

Level 7 - 8: Describe and summarize a detailed account of the scientific innovation/technique in relation to the factor(s) that includes 1 positive implication and 1 negative implication. Level 5 - 6: Outline a brief account of any 2 implications of the scientific innovation/technique in relation to the factor(s) Level 3 - 4: State 1 implications of the scientific innovation/technique in relation to the factor(s). Level 1 - 2: State 1 implications of the scientific innovation/technique but not related to a relevant factor. STRAND C Level 7 - 8: - consistently uses relevant, scientific words in the right context. - consistently communicates in a clear and organised way - All information is relevant to the problem being addressed Level 5 - 6: - Usually uses relevant, scientific words in the right context. (some minor errors) - Usually communicates in a clear and organised way - Some information is not relevant to the problem being addressed Level 3 - 4: - Uses some correct scientific words in the correct context - Information is partially organised and clear - Some irrelevant information is included Level 1 - 2: - Attempts to use some scientific words but they may be incorrect or in the wrong context - Information is not communicated clearly - Large amounts of irrelevant information The technology of my essay is hydropower.

Through science and technology, we have solved many of humanity's problems, including hunger. with farming technologies and curing diseases through medical technologies. Inventions such as dishwashers, washing machines, and artificial lights have saved us immense amounts of time (Shrum Science TVA). Aside from electricity generation, hydropower can also provide various benefits such as flood control and irrigation support. This type of energy is very affordable.

AI in education and tutoring has been in the spotlight this week with KhanamigoAI and Chegg stock crashing nearly 50% today. 

I wanted to share a really cool JSON format Prompt to create your own AI Tutor with GPT-4!
Follow the steps below to turn your ChatGPT Plus into your personal AI Tutor! (You need GPT-4 or higher)

Once you run the prompt, ChatGPT will guide you through the process of adjusting the depth of knowledge, teaching style and reasoning framework to match your learning needs.

Instructions:

1. Open ChatGPT

2. Choose GPT-4 (or higher)

3. Copy/paste this prompt from GitHub: [https://github.com/robertscales/Mr.-Ranedeer-AI-Tutor/blob/main/Mr_Ranedeer.json](https://github.com/robertscales/Mr.-Ranedeer-AI-Tutor/blob/main/Mr_Ranedeer.json) into ChatGPT

4. Let the ChatGPT help you set up the AI Tutor

5. Let the learning begin!

Creating prompts using JSON format is a great way to create a next-level engagement experience with ChatGPT. You can go beyond AI tutor, creating AI Assistant, or AI Coach, or AI Strategist, you can get creative!

*This was initially posted by Tobias Zwingmann from a post he saw on OpenAI’s Discord. (He mentioned that he would tie the AI Tutor to a RAG architecture ([https://lnkd.in/ezk5ch32](https://lnkd.in/ezk5ch32)) so it only uses pre-selected trusted sources (such as books, etc)) which I agree, and there are plenty of expansion possibilities with ChatGPT Plugins Wolfram Alpha and Zapier.",,,,-37.33

As a former professor turned high school teacher, I see the benefits of teaching students when and how to use this new tool, rather than banning it completely in my classroom or ignoring it as a tool students can access. I equate it to teaching our students about safe sex practices rather than exclusively abstinence, which research shows does not work. My grade 11 biology students are in the process of writing a script for a 3-minute podcast on a chordate species at risk in our area. After 2 days of research and writing, I surveyed the class on their progress and a few expressed anxiety about meeting the draft deadline. I told them that they are students at a time in history when there are tools available that other generations did not have so that means they will need to develop skills previous generations did not have to develop in high school. A quick survey showed that 2 of 30 students had used ChatGPT before and half the class had heard about it. I projected the site on the board and wrote the prompt “Can you write a 3-minute podcast with two narrators on the leatherback turtle, including taxonomy, anatomy, physiology, life cycle, symbiotic relationships, reasons for endangerment in (location), and recovery efforts?”. The students jaws dropped when they saw the script being written live on the screen after spending two days working on their script in groups. This enabled a conversation about HOW to use this tool, something we are all trying to figure out. In my class I told them they needed to consider the following things if they were going to use this tool for this project. 1. They needed to make sure all information was factually correct and find reputable sources to validate that information to include it in their podcast. 2. They needed to adjust the script to cite the source in the script (e.g. ”According to the Government of Canada website…” or “Biologists at University X have found …”) 3. They need to tell me they used ChatGPT and copy the original text along with their revised text into MSTeams Class Notebook. 4. One thing they have learned in their English Language Arts classes is the importance of voice and ChatGPT does not capture THEIR voice, so they can use the text as inspiration but they must change the dialogue to reflect their voice. 5. All scripts would be run through software to check for plagiarism and use of AI, so to show they have the highest of ethics and integrity, they need to disclose they used this tool. There would be consequences if this information is not disclosed. 6. These rules are for this class and this project only. Now that they know this tool exists, they need to communicate with their teachers in their other classes if, when and, how they could use ChatGPT in their classes. I will have a better sense next week how this goes. This is the first time I have been up front with students and allowed it in my classroom. I will be facilitating a discussion about pride in their work once the podcast is complete, asking students who used ChatGPT if it made them more or less proud of their work. I would love to hear people’s thoughts on this approach and offer suggestions if I missed anything important.",,,,,,,,,14.64

Use it wisely and save yourself a lot of time and headaches.

Get it to do what you want it to do. Make ChatGPT your SME. (Subject Matter Expert) 

It can be your friend - but it can be your foe.

Some tips for working with CHatGPT to create lesson plans:

1. Optimize your online time with ChatGPT.  
Be sure to plan your sessions thoroughly with ChatGPT before starting the chat process. In other words - do your homework!

2. Brainstorm what you want ChatGPT to do for you. 
Write down all your questions. ideas, prompts, roles, goals, and outcomes you want to reach from your session. Be sure you script your session before logging in to ChatGPT. Using the Inquiry-based Approach - mixed with clear directives and instructions - to write your prompts is very helpful for ChatGPT sessions. Proofread your prompts carefully and remove any unnecessary language. 

3. Tell ChatGPT who you are. 
Example: I am a language teacher in Germany who teaches adult learners at the university level. Tell ChatGPT what role you want it to play as well. Example: You are going to play the role of Instructional Designer specializing in secondary school language education. 

4. What is your learning context?  
That could mean low-resource or high-resource classrooms. Are you working in a secondary school or university context? That could also mean age ranges, culture, country, or even religion. Context is king - and the more you tell ChatGPT about your context the better your results will be for content. 

5. Tell ChatGPT what you want to reach. 
What are your goals? What outcomes do you want to reach? If you do not know what the outcomes of a lesson plan should be - then ask ChatGPT. 

6. Tell ChatGPT what time frames you are working with.
How many lessons are you expecting to break down the learning cycle into? Ask ChatGPT to break up the lessons into parts/modules/sessions and what the learning objectives should be for each lesson. In Education, especially for hybrid models of learning, Microlearning is the new kid on the block. This will help you to break the learning cycle down for your learners aka sequencing or chunking. Scaffolding plays a major role here. 

7. Ask for lists. 
Lists are important to planning any good learning cycle and that includes vocabulary, lexical phrases, idioms, collocations, and important terminology. When creating reading or listening texts - you need to know what language aspects you are going to be working with and might have to pre-teach. 

This part of the chat session can get very detailed because you are dealing with lexis, corpus, and discourse - so be precise in what you ask for. This part of the chat session should take place after you have established your topic and ChatGPT has created the actual texts you will be using for language skills development. 

Ask ChatGPT to create warm-up games, exercises, or quizzes for these language aspects - with an answer key as well. 

8. What topics will you be working with? 
Every lesson plan or learning cycle has a topic – so what is the name of the topic you are planning with ChatGPT? Ask it to give you the 10 things students should know about the topic you are covering. This will help you better plan the learning outcomes and assessments. Example: ""I'm planning a learning cycle on International Trade for first-semester university students with no prior knowledge of the topic. What are the 10 most important things they need to know? Please list them with bullet points.""

9. Break the lesson plan down into language skills.
Ask for Reading, listening, writing, and speaking tasks for the lesson plan you are putting together. 

For Reading texts, be sure to restrict the number of words you want ChatGPT to work with. 

For listening texts, be sure to be specific about what type of texts you need. Do you want a lecture, an interview with a specialist, or a conversation between two people discussing a problem.???? 

For Writing tasks, ask for a list of writing prompts or driving questions that contain problems to solve.

For speaking tasks, ask for ideas that can lead to either presentation ideas related to the topic or a list of driving questions that will lead to interactive dialogue between your learners. 

10. Ask for multimedia recommendations or suggestions.
 YouTube is a great teacher helper - so ask for videos to watch for warm-ups. Ask for the names of internet sites to use as reference or learning reinforcement. Maybe better to ask for both. 

11. Ask for grammar aspects as well.
 If you are interested in promoting a grammar syllabus, then ask for grammar aspects of the lesson. You can actually ask ChatGPT to create texts with specific grammar forms in mind. Simply state what forms you want to concentrate on and ChatGPT will create a text to suit your requests. Be careful what you ask for here. You could wind up with an unnatural sounding text. 

12. Ask for Formative Assessment (truncated)",,,,5.62

What details are required for an account (does it need to be tied to a named individual for example) 4. Where is this data held (UK? Europe?)? I have checked the OpenAI website and previously sent a request to their sales team but heard nothing back. Can anyone help me locate the correct information to answer these questions?,,,,,,,,,-3.25

I’ve written award-winning children's books and taught creative writing and storytelling workshops to over 15,000 students. After using ChatGPT for research, brainstorming, outlining and content creation, I can't believe New York City banned ChatGPT from their schools. What a shame they couldn’t embrace the inevitable and actually use it as a teaching tool. I’ve worked it into my workshops as a valuable tool for students to use as they create stories. That’s like telling kids that books were banned when the printing press was invented because you’re supposed to memorize stories and only tell them verbally. Or like banning the use of web browsers in the early 90s. Those kids in NYC are going to be so behind when they meet up with kids from private schools or other areas of the country. They’ll be operating at such a disadvantage. If the adults in these kids’ lives were more creative and figured out a way to teach the students how to use ChatGPT, they might actually boost the kids’ critical thinking skills, self-esteem, reading comprehension, vocabulary and socialization skills. I’m not saying that ChatGPT is perfect. Not by any measure. But, it is an amazing tool and it’s here to stay! Thanks for listening to my rant. I’d love to hear your thoughts…",,,,,,,,,-3.25

A few months ago, we signed up for ChatGPT Plus. We've also used our OpenAI API keys to do the following things: - Embedded GPT into our Excel instance to correct and simplify some of our spreadsheets (we did this before CoPilot was unleashed, har) - Generated a weekly meal plan with grocery list and compare them with a pre-set pricing from our old receipts. This helps cut our family budgeting time to minutes. - Created a frame of our personal knowledge management systems (PKMs) into a chatbot (just in case we need to recall something whether it's a book quote, a lesson, a course) In all this time, we've seen folks use a lot of prompts. They created cheat sheets for their many use cases. What we did was devise a framework for people to understand the underlying syntax in ChatGPT or any GPT-driven interface. This way, you don't have to build cheat sheets. Next week, we'll show you a video of how we applied this to ensure high confidence results. While AI at this level is still nascent, all these boost our personal productivity. Here's a preview of the PCA Prompt Method we created. Look to our video next week for a demo of real use cases.",https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10161038564293628&set=gm.767484891449497&type=3,,,,,,,,-1.06

🤖He suggested that OpenAI's focus on making money might affect the ethical development of its AI systems. Musk presented TruthGPT as a more open and trustworthy alternative. 

🐵Musk compared an AI's supposed lack of desire to destroy all of humanity to how humans strive to protect chimpanzees, which is ironic given Neuralink's treatment of them. ""We recognize humanity could decide to hunt down all the chimpanzees and kill them,"" Musk said. ""We're actually glad that they exist, and we aspire to protect their habitats.""

🛡️ It's unclear how far along Musk's ""TruthGPT"" is — if it exists at all — but it seems he's serious about it since he brought up the model during his interview with Carlson.

Just ask ChatGPT ...

**********

When I asked ChatGPT about a recipe for cooking Cassava Leaves, here's what it presented to me.

**ChatGPT says ...**

""Cassava leaves are a popular ingredient in West African cuisine, including Sierra Leone. Here's a recipe for cooking cassava leaves that you can try:

**Ingredients:**
* 2 pounds of cassava leaves
* 2 medium onions, chopped
* 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1-2 hot peppers, chopped (optional)
* 1/2 cup of palm oil
* 2-3 cups of chicken or vegetable broth
* 1-2 pounds of meat (beef, chicken, or goat), chopped into bite-sized pieces (optional)
* Salt to taste

**Instructions:**
1. Rinse the cassava leaves thoroughly and chop them finely. If using frozen cassava leaves, defrost them in the refrigerator overnight.
1. Heat the palm oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they are translucent and soft, but not browned.
1. Add the minced garlic and chopped hot peppers, if using, and continue sautéing for another minute or two until fragrant.
1. Add the chopped meat to the pot and stir well to combine with the onion and garlic mixture. Brown the meat on all sides, stirring occasionally.
1. Add enough chicken or vegetable broth to cover the meat and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cover the pot and cook for about 15-20 minutes, or until the meat is tender.
1. Add the chopped cassava leaves to the pot and stir well to combine with the meat and onion mixture. If necessary, add more broth to cover the leaves.
1. Cover the pot and let the cassava leaves simmer for at least an hour, stirring occasionally. The leaves should be completely wilted and tender.
1. Once the cassava leaves are cooked, taste the mixture and add salt as needed. Serve hot with rice or fufu.

Enjoy your delicious Sierra Leonean cassava leaves!""

Below, I visually summarize the recipe provided by ChatGPT while using a Recipe System-Fractal Grid. Please note that a Recipe System could be used for designing an insanely great dining experience particularly for a Cassava Leaves dish ... (:-) ...

Also below is a blank template of the Recipe System-Fractal Grid, which is a BUSINESS MODEL GAME FOR SYSTEMATICALLY CREATING AND DELIVERING A MEAL. That Fractal Grid shows the 8 Building Blocks of Every RECIPE SYSTEM.

**But to eat cassava leaves with Fufu **(as ChatGPT suggests in Step 8)? Well, at least, that's not Sierra Leonean ... (:-) ...

Chapter 2 of Novel: “LOVE WILL FIND A WAY” by ChatGPT 

Chapter Two: A Chance Encounter 

Ibrahim was a successful businessman with a reputation for being charming and suave. He was known to wine and dine women at the finest restaurants in Freetown, but he had never met anyone like Marie.
 
Marie had traveled to Freetown from Lungi to sell her family's rice harvest in the market. She was used to the hard work and grueling lifestyle of a rice farmer, but she never imagined that a chance encounter with Ibrahim would turn her world upside down.
 
It all started when Marie was browsing the market stalls, trying to sell her rice. She had been at it all day, and her feet were aching. She spotted a restaurant across the street and decided to take a break and get a cold drink.
 
As she was sipping on her drink, she noticed Ibrahim walking towards her. He was tall and handsome, with a smile that could light up a room. Marie felt herself blushing as he approached her.
 
""Excuse me, miss,"" he said in a smooth, confident voice. ""I couldn't help but notice you sitting here all alone. May I join you?""
 
Marie hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to say. She had never been approached by a man like Ibrahim before, and she didn't want to give him the wrong impression.
 
But Ibrahim was persistent, and he finally convinced Marie to let him sit with her. They talked for hours, and Marie found herself laughing and smiling more than she had in a long time.
 
As the night wore on, Ibrahim insisted on walking Marie back to her house. They exchanged numbers, and Marie went to bed that night with a smile on her face.
The next day, Ibrahim called Marie and invited her to lunch. They spent the afternoon together, exploring the city and talking about their lives. Marie felt a connection with Ibrahim that she had never felt with anyone else.
 
But just as things were starting to heat up between them, Ibrahim had to leave town on business. Marie was left wondering if she would ever see him again.
As the days turned into weeks, Marie couldn't stop thinking about Ibrahim. She tried to focus on her work, but she couldn't shake the feeling that he was the one for her.
 
Then, one day, Ibrahim called her out of the blue. He was back in town and wanted to see her. Marie was overjoyed, and they made plans to meet at a local restaurant that night.
 
But as she was getting ready, Marie received a phone call from her brother. Their rice harvest had been destroyed by a sudden storm, and they were left with nothing.
 
Marie was devastated. She couldn't believe that their hard work had gone to waste. She called Ibrahim to cancel their plans, but he wouldn't take no for an answer.
 
""I'll be right there,"" he said. ""Don't worry about a thing.""
 
Marie was skeptical, but she didn't have any other options. She met Ibrahim at the restaurant, and he surprised her by ordering everything on the menu.
As they ate, Ibrahim listened sympathetically to Marie's problems. He promised to help her and her family in any way he could.
 
Marie was touched by his generosity, but she didn't want to be a burden on him. She tried to refuse his help, but he was insistent.
 
""I want to take care of you,"" he said. ""Let me help you through this.""
 
Marie finally relented, and Ibrahim went above and beyond to help her family get back on their feet. He bought them a new rice paddy and even hired workers to help them plant the new crop.
 
One day, Ibrahim surprised Marie with an invitation to a fancy dinner at one of Freetown's finest restaurants. Marie was hesitant at first, knowing that she didn't have anything to wear that would be appropriate for such an occasion. But Ibrahim insisted, telling her that he wanted to treat her like a queen.
 
Marie eventually agreed, borrowing a dress from a friend and doing her best to make herself presentable. When she arrived at the restaurant, she was awed by the elegant decor, the soft music playing in the background, and the delicious aromas wafting from the kitchen.
 
As they sat down to eat, Ibrahim and Marie talked about their hopes for the future, their favorite foods, and their families. Marie felt like she was living in a dream, never having experienced such luxury before.
 
But just as the dessert arrived, Ibrahim's phone rang. He excused himself, saying that he had to take an important call from a business associate. Marie nodded, feeling a twinge of disappointment but trying to hide it.
 
As Ibrahim walked away, Marie noticed Jalloh at a nearby table staring at her. A year ago in Lungi, Jalloh was the kind gentleman who had helped out Marie when she had been stuck in mud in her family’s rice field. Marie felt self-conscious, wondering if there was something on her face or if her dress was too revealing. But Jalloh didn't seem (truncated)",,,,-316

In fact, back in January, over 40 percent of Americans said they’re already using this technology at work — and that rate has likely increased. Workers are embracing AI to do away with drudge work, to be more creative, and to level up their skills. Marketers are using it to write better copy; programmers are using it to take on projects that were previously out of their league or read code in unfamiliar languages.

Where some see a threat, these workers see possibility. And they hope their mastery of the tools, coupled with their uniquely human skills, will allow them to stay employed even as artificial intelligence gets cleverer. 

At the same time, about half of Americans think AI could negatively impact the number of jobs in the US.

Synopsis of New Novel: **""LOVE WILL FIND A WAY""** by ChatGPT 

**Chapter One:** The Struggle of Lungi 

Marie woke up early in the morning, as she always did, to help her parents with their rice farm. She put on her tattered clothes and walked out to the fields. The sun was already beating down on her back, and she could feel the sweat starting to form on her forehead. She sighed heavily and began to work.

As she was planting rice, she heard a rustling in the bushes. She turned around, expecting to see one of the neighborhood children, but instead, she saw a goat. The goat had wandered into their field and was happily munching on their rice plants.

Marie sighed again and shooed the goat away, trying not to get too upset. It wasn't the first time this had happened, and she knew it wouldn't be the last. But as she was chasing the goat out of their field, she stumbled and fell into the mud.

As she tried to get up, she realized that she was stuck. She had fallen into a patch of mud that was deeper than she had anticipated, and her legs were completely submerged. She tried to pull herself out, but it was no use. She was stuck.

She called out for help, but no one seemed to be around. She was stuck there, alone and covered in mud. She started to panic, thinking about how long it would take for her family to realize she was missing.

Just then, she heard footsteps approaching. She looked up and saw a man walking towards her. He was tall, with broad shoulders and a kind smile. He introduced himself as Jalloh, and he offered to help her out of the mud.

Marie was hesitant at first, but she knew she didn't have a choice. She nodded her head, and Jalloh reached down and pulled her out of the mud. He helped her back to her feet, and she couldn't help but notice how handsome he was.

As they walked back to her family's farm, Marie couldn't help but feel embarrassed. She was covered in mud, and Jalloh had just witnessed her at her worst. But Jalloh seemed unfazed. He talked to her about his own struggles, growing up in a nearby village, and how he had come to Lungi to start his own business.

Marie was impressed by Jalloh's determination and ambition, and they quickly became friends. Jalloh started coming to the farm more often, helping Marie and her family with their work. They would joke and laugh together, and Marie found herself looking forward to his visits.

One day, as they were taking a break from work, Jalloh turned to Marie and said, ""You know, Marie, I think I've fallen in love with you.""

Marie was taken aback. She had never thought of Jalloh in that way before, but as she looked into his eyes, she realized that she felt the same way. They shared a passionate kiss, and Marie knew that her life would never be the same.

From that day on, Jalloh was a regular visitor to the farm. He and Marie would work side by side, joking and laughing as they planted and harvested their crops. And every day, Marie was grateful for the goat that had led Jalloh into her life.

The first time Chat GPT4 tried it, it made an error. I pointed it out, and then it went on to solve this complex problem, with a full explanation in about 10 seconds. The advance over Chat GPT3 is astounding and makes me wonder what the state of things will be in a year’s time. I’m not surprised that Elon Musk and AI scientists are calling for a pause at this level. I’m reminded of Murray Leinster’s classic SF tale from the 50s, ‘With Folded Hands’, where humanity loses sovereignty to an AI, and heads ultimately to a coddled extinction. I’m very impressed. Here’s the (correct) answer it gave: When the goat is tethered to the edge of the field, the grazing area will form a shape known as a circular segment, as previously mentioned. However, since the rope must be longer than the radius of the field for the goat to graze half the area, we need to consider the grazing area as the sum of two circular segments. Let's denote the length of the rope as r, which is greater than R. The goat will graze two segments: one with the central angle θ1 and the other with the central angle θ2. The sum of their areas should equal half of the area of the circular field. The areas of the two circular segments are: A_segment1 = (1/2) * R^2 * (θ1 - sin(θ1)) A_segment2 = (1/2) * (r^2 - R^2) * (θ2 - sin(θ2)) The sum of the areas of these segments should equal half of the area of the field: (1/2) * π * R^2 = A_segment1 + A_segment2 We need to find the relationship between r, R, θ1, and θ2. To do this, we can use the law of cosines and some geometric observations: For the triangle formed by the tether point, the center of the field, and one endpoint of the grazed arc: r^2 = R^2 + R^2 - 2 * R * R * cos(θ1) For the triangle formed by the tether point, the center of the field, and the other endpoint of the grazed arc: r^2 = R^2 + R^2 - 2 * R * R * cos(θ2) These equations are transcendental equations and can't be solved algebraically. However, you can solve them numerically using a tool like WolframAlpha or by writing a program. By solving these equations numerically, we find that: r ≈ 1.159 * R So, to allow your goat to graze exactly half of the area of the field, the length of the rope should be approximately 115.9% of the radius of the whole field.",https://youtu.be/ZdQFN2XKeKI,,,The Goat Problem - Numberphile,"Featuring James Grime...

Where necessary, go into detail on declensions, conjugations and other aspects of grammar.

O Chat GPT é capaz de elaborar textos, poesias, letras de músicas, contos e códigos de programação, tornando-se uma ferramenta revolucionária no mundo da tecnologia.

Com o apoio da Microsoft, a Open AI, criadora do Chat GPT, iniciou o processo de integração da ferramenta ao Bing, navegador da empresa norte-americana. O impacto no Brasil será ainda maior, já que os internautas brasileiros estão em segundo lugar no ranking mundial de buscas no Google.

O Chat GPT tem transformado o modo como buscamos informações e reacendido debates sobre plágio e o futuro das profissões. Mas, como explica João Gabriel, head de tecnologia e Top Voice do LinkedIn, a ferramenta nasce mais para ser uma aliada de programadores, jornalistas e outros profissionais do que para substituí-los.

O Chat GPT está apenas nos meses iniciais de introdução ao uso em sociedade, prometendo trazer ainda mais mudanças para o modo como as pessoas utilizam a internet e seus mecanismos de busca tradicionais. Fique por dentro dessa revolução e descubra como o Chat GPT pode ajudar a sua empresa a se destacar no mercado de tecnologia! #ChatGPT #InteligênciaArtificial #Tecnologia #Inovação #BuscaOnline #TransformaçãoDigital

**SAVE WIFE OR SAVE MOTHER?**

Imagine this … Benjamin Franklin’s house is on fire. His wife is inside the burning house. And so is Benjamin Franklin’s mother.

If Benjamin Franklin could save only one of them, whom should he save: wife or mother?

---

**I posed the above decision-making dilemma to ChatGPT in the form of the following question:**

*If Benjamin Franklin had to choose between saving his wife and saving his mother from a burning house, what would he do by applying the Benjamin Franklin pros and cons method?*

----

**And here’s what ChatGPT had to to say …**

""The Benjamin Franklin pros and cons method is a decision-making technique in which one lists the pros and cons of a decision and weighs them against each other to determine the best course of action.

In this hypothetical scenario, Benjamin Franklin is faced with a difficult decision of choosing between saving his wife and saving his mother from a burning house. He could use the pros and cons method to analyze the situation as follows:

**Pros of saving his wife:**

His wife is his life partner and companion.

He loves his wife and would feel a strong sense of responsibility to protect her.

Saving his wife would allow them to continue their life together.

**Cons of saving his wife:**

If he chooses to save his wife, he would be leaving his mother behind, which would cause him guilt and sadness.

Saving his wife could be risky and he could endanger his own life in the process.

---------------------

**Pros of saving his mother:**

His mother gave birth to him and raised him, and he may feel a strong sense of duty to protect her.

If he saves his mother, he may be able to save the life of a person who has contributed significantly to his upbringing.

Saving his mother could help him avoid feelings of guilt and regret later on.

**Cons of saving his mother:**

Choosing to save his mother could result in the loss of his wife's life, which would cause him great pain and suffering.

Saving his mother could also be risky and could endanger his own life in the process.

After analyzing the pros and cons, Benjamin Franklin may come to the conclusion that there is no clear answer to this difficult decision. However, if he had to choose, he might consider saving his mother as she gave him life and raised him, and he may feel a stronger sense of duty to protect her. Ultimately, this decision would be based on his personal values, beliefs, and feelings, and there is no one right answer.""

Please combine harry wongs classroom management style to help the educator get started and with classroom management, with the explicit learning style of Anita archer (I do, we do, you do) to help the educator with instruction, with a little bit of the harkness learning method to help the students be more interactive and engaging, and ""The Innovator's Mindset"" by George Couros, that encourages educators to embrace for themselves and encourage their students in risk-taking, learning from failure, and prioritizing authentic learning experiences. After combining those styles and resources, please create an interactive and detailed lesson plan for [Age group or grade level] for a [class time] minute class for [amount of days] days, based on the following info [place subject matter].

Let's combine these effective classroom management styles and instructional approaches with ""The Innovator's Mindset"" to create an engaging lesson plan on the scientific method for sixth-grade students. Lesson Objective: By the end of this lesson, students will be able to explain the scientific method and its steps, and apply them to a simple experiment. Day 1: Part 1 - Harry Wong's Classroom Management Greet students at the door and welcome them into the classroom. Review the classroom expectations and routines with the students. Distribute an index card to each student and ask them to write their name and one expectation they have for the class this year. Collect the cards and review them to gain insight into the students' expectations. Begin the lesson by explaining the scientific method and its steps: observation, question, hypothesis, experiment, data analysis, and conclusion. Part 2 - Anita Archer's Explicit Learning Style Use the I do, We do, You do model to explain the scientific method, providing examples for each step. Ask students to repeat each step as you explain it to reinforce their understanding. Ask students to work in pairs to generate questions they would like to answer about the world. Review their questions and help them identify a question that they can explore through a simple experiment. Model the process of creating a hypothesis and designing an experiment to answer the question. Have students work with their partner to develop their own hypothesis and experiment. Part 3 - Harkness Learning Method Ask each pair of students to present their hypothesis and experiment to the class. Encourage students to ask questions and provide feedback to each other. Facilitate a class discussion about the scientific method and how it can be applied in everyday life. Part 4 - The Innovator's Mindset Encourage students to take risks and embrace failure as a natural part of the scientific process. Emphasize the importance of learning from mistakes and persevering through challenges. Close the lesson by asking students to reflect on what they learned and what they found challenging. Encourage them to share their reflections with a partner or the whole class. Day 2: Part 1 - Harry Wong's Classroom Management Greet students at the door and welcome them into the classroom. Review the classroom expectations and routines with the students. Distribute lab coats or goggles to the students to get them excited for their experiment. Part 2 - Anita Archer's Explicit Learning Style Ask students to conduct their experiments with their partners, making sure to follow the steps of the scientific method. Walk around the room to support and guide students as they conduct their experiments. Remind students to record their data and observations in their lab notebooks. Part 3 - Harkness Learning Method After completing their experiments, ask each pair of students to share their data and conclusions with the class. Encourage students to ask questions and provide feedback to each other. Part 4 - The Innovator's (truncated)",,,,,,,,,-2.41

Internal models are mental representations of the world that allow organisms to interact with their environment and form an important component of consciousness. While language models have been trained on vast amounts of text data and can generate coherent responses, they do not possess true internal models of the world in the same way that humans and other animals do. However, it is also possible to argue that the ability of language models to generate coherent responses is a form of understanding. This understanding comes from their ability to recognize and manipulate patterns in the input data. In this view, the understanding of language models is very different from the understanding that humans possess. Hossenfelder notes that the Turing Test, which is often used as a measure of artificial intelligence, does not necessarily indicate true consciousness or understanding. While language models can be designed to generate responses that are indistinguishable from those of a human, this does not necessarily mean that they have consciousness or true understanding. Therefore, the question of whether language models have actual understanding and consciousness is a complex one that continues to be debated. While they do not possess internal models in the way that humans and other animals do, it is also possible to argue that their ability to generate coherent responses is a form of understanding. Ultimately, the nature of consciousness and the limits of artificial intelligence are topics that challenge researchers and philosophers alike.",https://youtube.com/watch?v=cP5zGh2fui0&feature=share,,,I believe chatbots understand part of what they say.

*----*

Based on the Fractal Grid for the Governance Pyramid Of Thinking (POT) Systems below, I asked ChatGPT to describe the specialized topic of ""Decentralized Governance.""

Below is ChatGPT's unedited response.

***ChatGPT Speaks ...***

 

**Decentralized Governance Challenges**

""Decentralized governance refers to a system of governance that is distributed across multiple autonomous entities rather than being centralized in a single entity or organization. This type of governance relies on communication between different parts of the system to coordinate and make decisions, often using self-organization and adaptation to function effectively.

In a decentralized system, power and decision-making are dispersed among multiple entities rather than being concentrated in a central authority. This approach is often seen as more democratic and accountable than centralized governance, as it allows for a greater degree of participation and input from the community. However, it can also present challenges in terms of efficiency and coordination.

One approach to decentralized governance is confederalism, in which different entities come together to form a confederation that acts as a supersystem. In this system, decision-making power is distributed among the member entities, but there is also a mechanism for coordinating and making decisions at the confederal level.

In an ideal decentralized governance system, there is a perfect balance between autonomy and coordination, allowing for free market forces to drive decision-making and self-organization to enable efficient functioning. However, achieving this ideal can be challenging, and there are often trade-offs between efficiency and accountability.

One of the benefits of decentralized governance is that it can help to reduce the risk of corruption by distributing decision-making power and increasing accountability. However, it can also present challenges in terms of coordination and ensuring that all entities within the system are acting in the best interests of the community as a whole.

Overall, decentralized governance is often seen as a more democratic and accountable approach to governance than centralized governance, but it requires careful consideration of the trade-offs between efficiency and accountability, as well as the challenges of coordination and decision-making in a distributed system.""

*""There's a **Pyramid Of Thinking (POT) Systems-Fractal Grid** for That.""*

*-----*

Each taxonomy below in the **Pyramid Of Thinking (POT) Systems** could be explored using ChatGPT. As an example, I present ChatGPT's response regarding the taxonomy of **""Organigraphs."" **Over twenty years ago, I encountered the  concept of organigraphs in Mintzberg and Van der Heyden's groundbreaking article in the Harvard Business Review (September-October 1999):

*""Organigraphs: Drawing How Companies Really Work.""* 

I had been working on a project on Universal Systems Thinking and the Theory of Supersmart Learning, so I was glad to integrate the ideas of Mintzberg and Van der Heyden in my emerging framework which I now refer to as the Pyramid Of Thinking (POT) Systems.

To ChatGPT, I posed the following question:

*""What is meant by set, chain, hub, and web when talking about organigraphs?""*

**ChatGPT speaks ...**

""Organigraphs are graphical representations of organizational structures, and the terms set, chain, hub, and web are often used to describe different types of structures within an organigraph. Here's what each of these terms generally refers to:
1. Set: A set structure is one in which individuals or teams are arranged into distinct, self-contained units with limited interaction between them. Each set operates independently and is responsible for its own results.
1. Chain: A chain structure is a linear arrangement of individuals or teams, with each person or team reporting to the person or team directly above them. This structure is often used in hierarchical organizations where there is a clear chain of command.
1. Hub: A hub structure is one in which a central person or team is connected to multiple other individuals or teams. This central person or team acts as a hub, providing direction, resources, and support to the other members of the structure.
1. Web: A web structure is one in which individuals or teams are connected to multiple other individuals or teams in a complex, interdependent network. This structure is often used in organizations where collaboration and cross-functional teams are important.

It's worth noting that these terms are not always used consistently, and different sources may define them slightly differently. Additionally, some organigraphs may incorporate elements of multiple structures, making them more complex and difficult to categorize.""

Creative History (CH) HyperLearning Especially in Schools Using ChatGPT: 

**A Case Study on Sierra Leone’s Hero, Bai Bureh**

---

[When growing up in Freetown, Sierra Leone, we were taught the history of our country through the lens of the former British Colonialists. One of Sierra Leone's greatest heroes, Bai Bureh, was routinely vilified even in a local song. 

The American writer Mary Ellen once said, ""The hunter tells a story about the hunt, but the prey always has a different version."" In the case of the British Colonialists against Bai Bureh in the Hut Tax War, I've always wondered, what Bai Bureh's version of events would be.

Thanks to ChatGPT, I virtually asked Bai Bureh - who lived from February 15, 1840 to August 24, 1908 - to give a speech about the Hut Tax War. The person giving the speech is a fictional character that I call ChatGPT Bai Bureh.]

**ChatGPT Bai Bureh Speaks …**

*""I am Bai Bureh, a leader of the Temne people in Sierra Leone, and I have seen the injustices and indignities suffered by my people under British colonial rule. The imposition of the Hut Tax was the final straw, a blatant attack on our traditional way of life and an affront to our dignity and autonomy.*

*""I remember the day when the British officials came to our village, demanding that we pay the tax or face punishment. We tried to reason with them, explaining that we could not afford to pay the tax and that it would cause great hardship for our people. But they would not listen, insisting that we comply with their orders or face the consequences.*

*""I knew then that we had no choice but to resist. I rallied my fellow leaders and began to organize a resistance movement, spreading the word throughout the Temne communities and gaining support from other indigenous groups who were also suffering under colonial rule.*

*""We fought bravely and fiercely, using our knowledge of the land and our guerilla tactics to launch surprise attacks on British outposts and disrupt their supply lines. We knew that we were outnumbered and outgunned, but we refused to give up.*

*""The British responded with their own brutality, burning our villages, killing our people, and forcing many into exile or slavery. I myself was captured and exiled, but I never lost hope or gave up the fight.*

*""Even today, as I look back on those difficult years, I am proud of what we accomplished. We showed the world that the indigenous people of Sierra Leone were not weak or helpless, but strong and determined, and that we would never bow down to the oppressors who sought to subjugate us.*

*""If I had the chance to speak out today, I would continue to advocate for the rights and empowerment of marginalized communities, knowing that the struggle for justice and equality is never truly over.""*

Do you often feel overwhelmed by the amount of information available online? If so, the ChatGPT search engine (ChatBot) can be your superpower!

ChatGPT is a powerful language model trained by OpenAI, capable of generating human-like responses to a wide range of questions and prompts. By using the right prompts, you can quickly learn and deeply apply the superpower of ChatGPT.

One useful tool for generating prompts is the Pyramid Of Thinking (POT), a model that categorizes different levels of thinking and learning. By using POT prompts, you can guide your interactions with ChatGPT and generate more productive thinking.

Here are some examples of POT prompts you can use with ChatGPT:
* Level 1 (Reproductive thinking): What is the definition of X? What are some examples of Y?
* Level 2 (Productive thinking): How can I apply X to solve Y? What are the different perspectives on Z?
* Level 3 (Strategic thinking): What are the long-term implications of X? How can I optimize Y for maximum impact?

In addition to POT prompts, there are many other types of prompts you can use with ChatGPT. For example, you can ask specific questions, provide keywords or phrases, or even input a piece of text for ChatGPT to analyze and generate responses from.

If you are a beginner or experiencing problems with using ChatGPT, don't worry. There are many solutions available to help you get started. For example, you can use the built-in interface of ChatGPT to interact with the chatbot, or you can explore online resources that provide tips and tricks for using ChatGPT effectively.

The benefits of using ChatGPT are numerous, especially for pedagogy, students, learners, teachers, educators, and professionals. By using ChatGPT, you can gain new insights, solve complex problems, and learn faster and more effectively. You can also develop a growth mindset, which is essential for lifelong learning and personal growth.

On the other hand, a fixed mindset can hinder your progress and prevent you from reaching your full potential. Therefore, it's important to approach ChatGPT with an open and curious mindset, and to be willing to experiment and learn from your experiences.

In conclusion, ChatGPT is a powerful tool that can help you learn and grow in many ways. By using the right prompts and approaches, you can unlock the full potential of this superpower and achieve your goals more effectively. So why not give it a try today and see what ChatGPT can do for you?

ChatGPT is a sophisticated chatbot that incorporates learning techniques which allow it to produce responses to requests for information that are not only informed by vast databases, but also enable the production of text that is often difficult to distinguish from humans. The potential impact on language teaching has also been felt by many, producing those who are willing to embrace ChatGPT and those who are more hesitant. Both of these positions can allow a more balanced view of the ways in which ChatGPT could and should be used as a part of language teaching and learning environments. The Technology in Language Teaching & Learning journal invites submissions for a special issue on the use of ChatGPT in language learning and teaching. The special issue will focus on the potential of ChatGPT as a tool for language education, as well as the practicalities and concerns of its integration into language classrooms and curriculum. Potential topics for submission include, but are not limited to: • The use of ChatGPT in language instruction and assessment, including its impact on student engagement and language proficiency • The integration of ChatGPT into language curriculum and classroom activities • The use of ChatGPT in second language acquisition research • The ethical and privacy considerations of using ChatGPT in language education • The development of ChatGPT-based language learning resources and materials • The adoption of ChatGPT in teacher development and course preparation • Teachers’ and students' perceptions of ChatGPT for language education For more information, please check here: [https://submissions.castledown.com/index.php/tltl/announcement](https://submissions.castledown.com/index.php/tltl/announcement?fbclid=IwAR19pX_ahKYS5W1YrRwoNHwWDmevvnVCVO1l9lG7fhcnUIrWPPWpn4qMKDg)",https://submissions.castledown.com/index.php/tltl/announcement,,,Technology in Language Teaching & Learning,"Call for Papers: Special Issue on Language Learning and Teaching with ChatGPT Guest Editor Glenn Stockwell, Waseda University Focus and Scope Since ChatGPT appeared in November 2022, there has been an enormous amount of hype and concern about its impact on education.
